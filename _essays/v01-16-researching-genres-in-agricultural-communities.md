abstract: |
  In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, agriculture was not keeping pace with other areas of the U.S. economy, prompting the creation of institutions such as land-grant colleges, experiment stations, and the extension service. The modernizing trends underlying these institutions, intended to promote specialized education and standardized practices, arose out of the ideologies of progressivism and represented a response to rapidly changing social dynamics. Political acts directed at farming signaled the increasing role of a federal bureaucracy intent on managing the development of the agricultural sector, and the written communications, or genres, employed in the effort reveal the interactions between institutions and local communities. Farm and 4-H record books—extension service genres—had direct contact with, and effects upon, farming communities, and were thus able to influence farmers and future farmers by establishing progressive ideas of commerce, science, and technology. In this paper we argue that traces of these institutional knowledge transmission efforts can be charted through the promotion of the farm and 4-H record book in newspapers of the time, and that combining genre analysis with a targeted digital search interface can illuminate these traces and enhance other qualitative methods.

While much of U.S. industry experienced increased productivity and
economic vitality in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,
agriculture was seen to lag behind and present an area open to change
through reorganization, systemization, and science-based principles of
production.[^1] The 1914 Smith-Lever Extension Act emerged from Congress
with the goal of providing farmers with specialized education and
standardized practices, setting the stage for agricultural knowledge to
become a formalized sphere for technical and scientific inquiry. It was
hoped that, just as progressive ideas had transformed the U.S.
manufacturing economy, they would similarly reshape agricultural
processes.

The period that produced Smith-Lever was an era of activism and
optimism, and ideas of scientific and organizational advancement
impacted all areas of the social and economic spectrum. The modernizing
trends shaping farm production arose out of the ideologies of
progressivism, and represented a response to rapidly changing social
dynamics: industrialization, migration, a growing recognition of social
disparities, and a growing faith in science and technology as pathways
to a new, orderly, improved world.[^2] Political acts directed at
farming signaled the increasing role of a federal bureaucracy that
sought to control the development of the agricultural sector; these
included the 1862 Morrill Act, which made possible the state land-grant
colleges, and the 1887 Hatch Act, which funded experiment stations at
the colleges.[^3] The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),
which oversaw these institutions, also dates to 1862. The USDA
"harnessed the scientific expertise of the Department" by "linking the
public land grant colleges, farm groups, and individual farmers who
participated in cooperative learning of new methods" through the
creation of a public-private mission in the Smith-Lever extension
service.[^4]

The federal government, invested in the success of agricultural
enterprises through the scientific and economic research produced in the
land-grant colleges, experiment stations, and extension service,
provided additional financial support in the form of the 1916 Federal
Farm Act.[^5] While initially intended to facilitate greater production
for World War I, this push to support the actual production processes of
farming fit into a larger vision of social and economic rationality
intended to boost the overall development of the country, and thus
continued to expand after the war was won.[^6] The availability of
financing allowed farmers to invest in land, machinery, and chemicals,
and the new technologies led them to rely more and more on the
institutions---the extension service, land-grant colleges, and
experiment stations---that had been created to enable rapid
modernization.[^7]

The institution with the greatest immediate contact with farmers, the
extension service, generated genres such as administrative forms and
reports, research articles, educational brochures, and bookkeeping
ledgers. In this context, genres---identifiable through form, content,
and intent---are written texts recognizable as responses to recurring
communication situations.[^8] Genres are intrinsically connected to
social actions and relationships, an idea emerging from rhetorical genre
theory.[^9] Genres help construct knowledge and transmit world views,
shaping rhetorical situations; they are "one of the structures of power
that institutions wield."[^10] Some of these institutional genres had
direct contact with, and effects upon, farming communities, and were
thus able to influence farmers by establishing progressive ideas of
education, improvement, and industry. In this paper, we argue that
traces of these knowledge transmission efforts can be charted through
the institutional promotion of the farm and 4-H record book genres, and
that combining genre analysis with a targeted digital search interface
can illuminate these traces.

Signs of genre activity are apparent in both the physical and digital
archives, as well as personal interviews. For this research we employed
our project, *Historical Agricultural News*, or *HAN*, to improve the
process of finding digitized newspaper sources in *Chronicling America*
(*ChronAm*) through article-level searches.[^11] Our search tool enables
users to filter agriculturally-related topics in digitized newspaper
articles, so searches for the key term "record books" can be limited to
an agricultural context. While we recognize this is not a perfect
representation of data (not all newspapers have been digitized, and some
existing digitized projects have poor quality machine readable text), it
still provides a qualitative overview for analysis. *HAN* is delimited
to a list of organizations we identified as a sub-dataset, with the
primary goal of locating mentions of the extension service, land-grant
colleges, and experimental farms. For our research, we performed an
analysis of the times and contexts in which record books are mentioned
in *ChronAm* newspapers, not a rhetorical analysis of actual record
books.

{% endfigure %}

The farm record book was a feature of progressive institutional
involvement from early in the extension service program.[^12] Developed
as a form of business ledger in conjunction with the USDA, the record
book not only allowed farmers to formalize their processes, but also
enabled the extension service to track their own influence in farming
communities. The record book, which formalized the kinds of information
farmers recorded, was both distributed and collected by the extension
service and reported annually. Extension service reports were generated
at district, state, and national levels, and the inclusion of farm
record books in these reports indicate the value they represented as
data-collection instruments.[^13]

The table illustrates the mentions of record books in the annual Florida
state reports.[^14] In the earliest reports, the agents note how many
farmers keep either full or partial records of farm accounts. Later
reports indicate that the agents actively assisted farmers with
recording-keeping, and by the 1923 report,[^15] agents recorded how many
books they handed out. The 1939 report[^16] shows a great jump in both
quantities of books kept and of numbers of individuals assisted with
accounting by extension service agents, and the narrative section in the
1944 report notes that

> Farm record books have been supplied to more than 2,000 farmers and
> assistance has been given to many of them in entering inventories and
> otherwise posting their books. Noted improvement has been made by
> farmers in their record keeping during [the] 1944 Report as a result
> of their realization of the advantages to be obtained from accurate
> records when they compute income tax returns.[^17]

{% endfigure %}

Interpreting the spread of the farm record book from the perspective of
genre as social action suggests it was transferring ideologies and over
time influencing farmers to think of their farms in terms of business
operations. However, in Galbreath's earlier research and interviews with
contemporary farmers on this topic, few were familiar with the
books.[^18] The oldest interviewee, born in 1923, did remember them, and
spoke of the record books in connection with his vocational agriculture
classes in the 1940s. He noted that "you didn't make enough money, but
then you had to keep the books up to what you bought and spent, and
[what you're going to] make in advance, and then see what you really
did make, and all that, which it's a lot of government-type work . . .
it doesn't turn out too good with this weather."[^19] From his
perspective, the "bookwork" did not meet the reality of farming---the
uncertainties of weather events and other uncontrollable forces of
nature. Other interviews revealed the positive significance of genre
participation in the youth arm of the extension service---the 4-H.[^20]
These younger farmers, born and raised in a farming environment, still
recalled the "new" knowledge they gained from 4-H work and the project
records they kept, indicating that those related genres might also be
communicating progressive world views.[^21]

Prior research into the area of Boys and Girls Clubs and the 4-H
acknowledge the importance of project records as learning and leadership
exercises. In his 1951 history of the 4-H, Franklin M. Reck claims that
the education gained from 4-H project work "ties learning to living with
the closest possible bond," with record books providing both mathematics
and English practice.[^22] Tracy S. Hoover, et al. argue that the
"learning and skill development" gained in these exercises indicate an
"underlying philosophy that youth would also teach new agricultural
practices to their parents."[^23] Contextualizing 4-H learning as
"hybrid literacies,"[^24] I. Moriah McCracken aligns the educational
value of the record books with "bureaucratic (and adult) standards for
discourse and literacy."[^25] This view suggests similar motives as in
the distribution of the adult farm record books, and she notes that the
identification requests embedded in the forms assisted in national
tracking.[^26]

The project record is an introductory text, with simplified categories
from the adult farm record ledgers, and early examples of both show the
similarities in genre features. The layout and content for both the farm
record book and the project record reflect the goal of having both
youths engaged in club work and veteran farmers thinking about farming
from an organizational perspective. But how did the extension service
promote these genres, and how was this inculcation perceived at the
local level?

Our research into these questions suggests that evidence of both farm
records and project books is available in the *ChronAm* database. In the
case of the farm record books, using *HAN* to search through all the
organizations for the years 1836--1922 turned up 102 results, 76 of
which had content specifically pertaining to farm record books.[^27]
These were captured through a downloadable spreadsheet that contains
citation information, the article text, and a link to the original
newspaper page.

An example from a 1917 *Norwich Bulletin* article opens by stating
"Farming is fast becoming recognized as a business and in order to
realize the best possible returns it is necessary to have absolute
knowledge of the business methods which apply to it."[^28] Highlighting
progressive thinking, the article proceeds to compare the successful
farmer with a merchant and emphasizes the sad situation for farmers who
"won't try to know," directing farmers to the local extension service
for help getting started with the account book. Other articles indicate
the importance the extension service placed on the record books for farm
success, bank approvals, and income tax verification, and one carries a
stern warning of lost work days and fines from "not furnish[ing] a
proper report to the income tax collector."[^29]

This example, promoting the farm record book, shows the connections between the different institutions of agricultural college, financial institutions, farm bureau, and Internal Revenue Service. Farmers are encouraged to use the record book not just to build a successful business, but also as a way to establish credibility with the bank and verifiability with the IRS." %}

This early example from the *HAN* search shows how the extension service advertised the utility of the farm record book. Words such as “simple” and “free of charge” are meant to encourage farmers to attend demonstrations. Also visible in this article is the tracking and inventory the extension service will conduct at the end of the year, when the “books will be taken up and summarized.”" %}

In this example, the benefits of keeping a farm account book are combined with the idea that teaching these methods to boys will ensure the continuation of family farming by “keep[ing] those same boys on the farm.”" %}

{% endfigure %}

Conducting a search with *HAN* for evidence of Boys and Girls Club
project books, limiting organizations to Boys and Girls Clubs, and
looking at the years 1836--1922, we found 34 articles that mentioned the
key term "record" (the most prevalent reference to the project record
book). We located references that demonstrated not only the use of
project records, but also indicated how this idea was permeating the
public consciousness. For example, an article from 1916 notes that
"Through the keeping of accurate records of their operations the boys
and girls receive training in farm management," and "Not only are they
beating their parents in production, but they are also stimulating their
parents toward better farming methods and larger yields."[^30] Other
articles mention competitions, including county and state fairs, in
which completed reports are a critical component of judging,[^31] and
Boys and Girls Poultry Clubs, which were argued as a means to improve
the poultry market in Florida and one of the requirements of which were
"the keeping of accurate records of the amount of feed, labor, number of
eggs produced, chickens raised, marketed, etc."[^32]

{% figure caption: "Figure 8. “Union County Boys and Girls Clubs Make Superb Record During the Past Year,” *Clayton News* (Clayton, NM), Dec. 1, 1917, [*Chronicling America*](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn93061573/1917-12-01/ed-1/seq-1/pdf). The project record is a large part of judging criteria for the competitions involving Boys and Girls Clubs, prizes for which included cash awards and trips to the annual state Boys and Girls Club camp." %}
![Black and white image of newspaper article about Boys and Girls club work](/assets/img/v01/galbreath/figure8.png)
{% endfigure %}

As a genre, the project record brought the "new" knowledge the young
people learned in their Boys and Girls Clubs (and later 4-H) activities
together with their community farming experiences, shaping their
perspective of farming as a business and a viable career choice. As
argued in a 1922 article,

> If we can get them interested in the beauties of nature, the wonders
> of plant and animal life; if we will go a step further and show them
> the possibilities for profit, for making money in agricultural
> pursuits, we can win them to the farm and keep them there, to the
> great benefit of themselves and the country. A way has been found to
> do this through the medium of the boys' and girls' club work.[^33]

Young farmers learned confidence, organizational skills, and other
leadership qualities from their transitional experiences in the youth
agricultural organizations supported by the extension service. The
professional farmer identities they gained there were not in opposition
to the community dialogues and understandings with which they grew up,
but were structured in a way that supported the goals of the extension
service and all the institutions with which it aligns: the experiment
stations, the land-grant college, and the USDA. The progressive
ideologies transmitted through the social action of these genres, like
the processes transferred through the project record, are not always
visible, but nonetheless helped shape modern agricultural practices and
our understanding of them.

### Notes

[^1]: The deficiencies of agricultural production were pointed out in
    Theodore Roosevelt's *Report of the Country Life Commission*, which
    was sent to Congress in 1909. The report highlighted the problem for
    the economy in general if farm work was not brought up to the
    efficiencies in other sectors.

[^2]: Rodgers, "In Search of Progressivism"; Sanders, "Rediscovering
    the Progressive Era." Rodgers argues that "those who called
    themselves progressives did not share a common creed or a string of
    common values, but they used three "distinct social languages---to
    articulate their discontents and their social visions." These were
    "the rhetoric of antimonopolism," "an emphasis on social bonds and
    the social nature of human beings," and "the language of social
    efficiency" (123). The language of social efficiency, with "schemes
    to reorganize government on business lines," by extension imparted
    business methods into everything government touched---including
    agriculture (126). Sanders contends that, while progressives had
    varying political alliances, "they shared an assumption of linear
    progress; progressives could be said to be modernization theorists"
    (1282).

[^3]: First Morrill Act, 7 U.S.C. § 301; United States Department of Agriculture, "The Hatch Act of 1887."

[^4]: Sanders, "Rediscovering the Progressive Era," 1291.

[^5]: Gregg, "From Breadbasket to Dust Bowl"; Worster, *Dust Bowl*. Gregg points out that those involved
    in expanding agricultural production---"farmers, businessmen, and
    government officials"---were of a mind that modernization was
    critical to the country, and thus supported the "altered
    relationship" the Farm Act represented. She asserts "These new
    practices brought increased efficiency and the maximization of
    resources, and most Americans embraced them as the benefits of a
    modernizing age, not anticipating the unintended economic and
    ecological consequences of these policies" (129--30). Worster writes
    about the effects of the expansionist thinking and rhetoric that led
    to overdevelopment of the Great Plains, a utilitarian perspective in
    which the dominant philosophy underlying modernization was
    capitalism (7).

[^6]: Bensel, *The Political Economy of American Industrialization*; Fitzgerald, *Every Farm a Factory*.           Bensel makes the claim that the "rapid industrialization" the U.S. saw after the
    Civil War and into the turn of the century was a product of
    "inseparably and intimately interconnected" political and economic
    development processes (17). He observes that these processes
    exacerbated demographic differences between an industrial north and
    mainly agricultural south. Fitzgerald argues that the changes urged
    upon agriculturalists represented "an industrial logic" that linked
    capital, raw materials, transportation networks, communication
    systems, and newly trained technical experts" into interlocking webs
    (3).

    frame recurrent texts occurring in everyday rhetorical situations as
    participants in social action, arguing that the writing not only
    responds to situational needs and constraints, but actively shapes
    situations of which the genres are an inherent part.

    Rhetorical genre theory builds on Miller's argument for using texts
    to understand social interactions. Bazerman argues that "people
    using text create new realities of meaning, relation, and
    knowledge," and a text that performs as intended "creates for its
    readers a social fact" (309--11). Also see Devitt, *Writing Genres*;

    books as "part of the toolkit of the progressive farmer, and the
    importance of recordkeeping from a scientific and business
    perspective was being promoted by interested parties, including
    agricultural colleges, the USDA, bankers' associations, and the farm
    press" (269).

[^18]: The community Galbreath researched for her dissertation, Samsula,
    Florida, was settled in the early twentieth century primarily by
    immigrants from Slovenia and other eastern European countries who
    were attracted to the area by advertisements for affordable,
    newly-drained farm land. Their descendants were the subjects of
    Galbreath's interviews.

    met, according to Keathley and Ham, was the difficulty the

    promising methods and practices." Keathley and Ham, "4-H Club Work

    McCracken does not specifically mention genre theory, her insights
    support the idea that the project record book participated in the
    social action of conveying progressive and institutional farming
    ideas by grooming young agriculturalists for a business model
    ideology of farming.

[^27]: *Historical Agricultural News* was created as a response to the
    2016 National Endowment for the Humanities *Chronicling America*
    Data Challenge. Copyright laws and the contents of *Chronicling
    America* constrained *HAN*'s website and data, limiting the date
    range from 1836 to 1922 and to only those papers within *ChronAm* at
    the time the current dataset was created (*ChronAm* has since
    expanded their date range). The project's article parser created the
    standalone *HAN* dataset by extracting articles from *ChronAm* which
    specifically contained agricultural organization terms (agricultural
    co-operative, boys and girls clubs, country life commission,
    experiment station, extension service, farm bureau, farm
    organization, horticultural society, land-grant colleges, and
    agricultural supply company). Additionally, since the HAN dataset is
    restricted to agricultural organizations, only if an article
    discussing farm record books also included an agricultural
    organization would it have been pulled into the *HAN* dataset to be
    available for this current research. The date range for this paper
    was further limited as the legislative acts which created the
    extension service and formalized the use of farm record books began
    in 1914.
