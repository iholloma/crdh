  The Russian influenza, which first received broad attention in St. Petersburg in November 1889 and spread across Europe and into the Americas over the next two months, occurred at a critical moment in the development of mass journalism, medical knowledge, and information technology. In this context, the question of whether “influenza is the forerunner of cholera” was prompted by a single statement by Russian physician Nikolai Fedorovich Zdekauer, made during a scholarly meeting in St. Petersburg yet quickly disseminated globally through newspapers and medical journals. Tracing the reporting on Zdekauer’s statement reveals how quickly misinformation could be transmitted on a global scale at a time of heightened concern about the threat of widespread disease. Yet these same sources, including newspapers and medical journals, also demonstrate how quickly both the leading authorities in medical science and publications aimed at public audiences questioned these reports and presented authoritative alternatives based on reasoned analysis. Affirming the dissimilarity of influenza and cholera also served to affirm the value of a public sphere which allowed for measured discussion, thoughtful intervention, and the articulation of an emerging scientific consensus about disease etiology.

On December 15, 1889, the *Omaha Daily Bee* newspaper quoted a French
physician, Dr. Albert Robin of the Academy of Medicine, about the
possible relationship between the influenza epidemic spreading across
Europe and a future outbreak of cholera: "The theory has been advanced
that the influenza is the forerunner of cholera, but I regard that as
pure nonsense." Robin stated that although at various times "an
influenza epidemic has been closely followed by a visitation of the
cholera," it is equally true that "several times in the same century
there has been an epidemic of influenza with no cholera following, just
as there have been epidemics of cholera with no influenza preceding."
Robin concluded: "The fact is that the two diseases are so utterly
dissimilar as to make any such sequence all but impossible, and any
occasional instances of their simultaneous appearance must be regarded
as mere coincidences, with no deeper significance in the matter of
treatment."[^1]

Analyzing this statement by Robin using a digital humanities approach
can enhance scholarly understanding of significant questions about the
functioning of medical networks on a global scale; the relationship
between expert knowledge and public understanding; and the role of new
technologies in shaping beliefs and attitudes. In this example, an
American newspaper quoted a European expert invoking scientific
knowledge of how diseases are transmitted in order to reassure the
public about a public health threat. Just as the relatively new
technologies of global news reporting by transoceanic cables allowed for
rapid transmission of information on a global scale in 1889, the
availability of digitized collections of newspapers with full text
search capacity allows the historian to quickly and thoroughly track the
spread of information on a global scale. Locating the article cited here
from the *Omaha Daily Bee* through a keyword proximity search of
digitized newspapers is an example of how digital humanities tools have
transformed historical analysis.[^2] The Russian influenza, which first
received broad attention in St. Petersburg in November 1889 and spread
across Europe and into the Americas over the next two months, occurred
at a critical moment in the development of mass journalism, medical
knowledge, and information technology, as the telegraph allowed news to
spread faster than diseases at the same time that bacteriological
research revealed distinct paths of contagion.[^3] The fact that a daily
newspaper in Nebraska published an interview with a French scientist was
very common in this historical context where public discourse included
extensive international reporting on medical topics. Yet Robin's
dismissal as "pure nonsense" the prediction that influenza would lead to
cholera raises historical questions best addressed through methods of
close reading, contextual analysis, and layered interpretation.

In fact, this question of whether "influenza is the forerunner of
cholera" was prompted by a single statement by Russian physician Nikolai
Fedorovich Zdekauer.[^4] As reported in the St Petersburg daily
newspaper, *Novoe Vremia*, on November 18 [29], 1889, Zdekauer told
the Society for the Improvement of Public Health that influenza could be
followed by an even greater threat to public health:

> With great interest those in attendance listened to the opinion of the
> authoritative scientist, prof. N. O. Zdekauer, who appeared in the
> middle of the symposium. Prof. Zdekauer notes that influenza on its
> own is not dangerous, but there are circumstances that make it
> necessary to think seriously about influenza. During his many years,
> he lived through 4 choleras and each of these choleras were preceded
> by influenza and it is possible to imagine that this epidemic is a
> precursor to that cholera that comes to us from Asia. Moving from
> Turkey to Syria, Mesopotamia, this cholera is now coming from Persia.
> There are suppositions that the influenza microbe, having survived the
> winter in our soil, may develop into cholera in the spring. In this
> consideration, warned Zdekauer, we need to pay attention to improving
> the health of the city, as the experiences of 1830, 1848, 1865, and
> 1884 show that even a quarantine does not guarantee the end of
> cholera. The most recent choleras develop most of all in Spain and Italy,
> countries with more positive conditions in terms of sanitation.
> Cholera almost never appears in England, a country with excellent
> sanitary conditions.[^5]

The potential impact of this comment became evident in the first
international report published on December 2, 1889 in the *London
Standard*:

> At the meeting yesterday of the Russian Association for the
> Preservation of the Public Health, Professor Zdekaner [sic], the
> first authority in Russia, said he had witnessed five epidemics of
> cholera, each of which was preceded by an epidemic of influenza such
> as that now raging. He considered it highly probable that the present
> disease would be succeeded by cholera next Spring. He called on the
> authorities, therefore, to undertake at once such sanitary measures as
> had led to such excellent results in England.[^6]

On the same day, the *St. Paul Daily Globe* offered a slightly
abbreviated report under the ominous headline, "Forerunner of Cholera":
"Prof. Zdenecker [sic], one of the leading Russian medical
authorities, declares his belief that the influenza now prevailing here
is a forerunner of cholera. The same signs, he says, preceded the last
five cholera epidemics here."[^7]

Tracking term frequency in digitized newspaper collections (see figures
1--4) clearly indicates how Zdekauer's statement changed reporting on the
relationship between these two diseases. Whereas the two terms rarely
appeared in the same sentence, paragraph, or phrase prior to December
1889, suggesting the two diseases were not seen as connected, the impact
of Zdekauer's statement and subsequent responses could be seen in the
marked increase in results of proximity searches across newspaper
titles. Keyword searches can document continuity and change, two key
issues for historical scholarship, but they do not reveal meaning or
demonstrate causation. Close reading reveals that many newspapers and
medical journals actually challenged Zdekauer's statement. On December
3, 1889, *The Times* of London offered a sweeping denial of remarks that
the same newspaper had reported one day earlier:

> The suggestion, however, which has been attributed to Professor
> Zdeckauer [sic], to the effect that the epidemic now existing in
> Russia is probably premonitory of cholera in the spring, is one which
> appears to derive no support from either reason or experience. The two
> diseases are totally unlike one another, and probably the only
> recorded coincidence between them, even in point of time, is that, as
> already mentioned, influenza followed soon after cholera in the
> country in 1833.

{% figure caption: "Figure 1. This chart shows the distribution of search results for two keywords, influenza and
cholera, in two newspaper collections, Chronicling America and America’s Historical
Newspapers, by year, from 1885 to 1894. The chart indicates that the term cholera appeared on
more pages in every year than the term influenza, although the gap was narrowest in 1890, which
included the peak of Russian flu coverage in January. The spike in cholera results in 1892
certainly resulted from the outbreak of this disease in the Middle East, Russia, and Europe." %}

these collections. By adjusting the yearly segments to begin in June and end in May, this chart
illustrates the significant increase in reporting in late 1889 and early 1890 associated with the
Russian Flu, thus providing a more accurate visualization of change over time." %}

be seen in December 1889, immediately following the widely reported statement by Zdekauer.
The very low number of results from June to November suggest that the lack of significant
connections between these two terms, by contrast not only to December 1889 but even to the continued collocation of these terms through the spring of 1890." %}

{% figure caption: "Figure 4. As a way to compare results across national newspaper collections, this chart shows
the results of keyword searches for influenza and cholera in the British Historical Newspaper
collection, a commercial database of digitized newspapers. In this collection, cholera appeared
more frequently than influenza from 1885 to 1889 and again in 1893 while influenza appeared
more frequently in 1890--1892 and 1894. This chart shows different results than figure 1 for
American newspapers. While the British results were probably affected by the greater impact of
the 1892 influenza in Britain, as compared to the United States, it is more likely that these results
reflected the frequency of advertising terms, which requires a whole different method to parse." %}

{% endfigure %}

This challenge was articulated in a most authoritative way by the
*British Medical Journal* on December 7, 1889: "The theory which has
again been given currency in the telegrams from St. Petersburg that
epidemic influenza is a forerunner of cholera need only be mentioned in
order that it may be condemned as utterly unfounded." While influenza
and cholera epidemics may occur in chronological proximity, the pattern
"has abundantly proved that there is no kind of causal connection."[^8]
In the United States, the *Medical Record* offered an equally sweeping
statement in a front-page editorial on December 14, 1889:

> We observe that some feeling of alarm prevails lest this epidemic be a
> precursor to cholera, as was the case in 1831 and 1847. There have
> been, however, plenty of cholera epidemics without a preceding
> influenza, and a great many influenza epidemics without any associate
> cholera. The micro-organisms of the two diseases are as essentially
> different as are the diseases themselves. The cholera germ lives in
> water and soil, the influenza germ in the air. The relationship
> between the two diseases has been, we believe, purely accidental.[^9]

Newspapers also cited the opinions of doctors, either individually in
interviews[^10] or as the collective view of the profession, as in this
*New Haven Register* article on December 14, 1889:

> One reason why this disease is dreaded is because it is thought by
> many to be a sure forerunner of Asiatic cholera. This is based upon
> the fact that some previous outbreaks of this sort have been followed
> by the dread visitation of cholera. The best physicians are not
> entirely agreed upon the subject, but perhaps the balance of opinion
> is in favor of the belief that the two diseases are in no way
> connected. We have no more reason to fear an outbreak of the cholera
> now than ever before.

This statement, "the two diseases are in no way connected" acknowledges
the difference between causation and correlation: doctors agreed that
the two diseases were not causally connected, in the sense that
influenza could not cause cholera nor were the causes of the two
diseases at all similar. As this review of evidence clearly suggests,
however, the two diseases were connected because they were part of the
medical imagination of the era and thus appeared in proximity to each
other in newspapers, journals, and doctors' public statements.[^11]

Zdekauer was aware of how his statement had been misinterpreted and
tried to correct the record. On December 3 (15), 1889, the Russian
newspaper *Novoe Vremia* published his letter claiming that his remarks
"had been misrepresented in the press." Zdekauer denied that he had
claimed any organic connection between the two diseases, but he affirmed
instead the goal of raising concerns about cholera with the intention of
prompting the Society and government to implement sanitary measures,
which were described in some detail in the rest of the letter.[^12]
Through this public appeal, Zdekauer engaged with debates prompted by
misinterpretations of his comments which had been reproduced,
questioned, and repudiated on a global scale.

This study of reports about causal relationships between influenza and
cholera builds upon, but also challenges, the analysis of viral texts
published by Ryan Cordell in an influential article in *American
Literary History*.[^13] Drawing on the materials and methods associated
with the Viral Texts digital humanities project, Cordell makes extensive
use of digitized newspapers to explore the "networks of information
exchange" created, sustained, and broadened by selection and
republication of texts. Cordell introduces the concept of "network
author" to illustrate "the ways in which meaning and authority accrued
to acts of circulation and aggregation" across mid-nineteenth century
American newspapers. Using Cordell's analytical framework suggests that
references to cholera and influenza were "textual clusters," similar to
those identified by the Viral Texts algorithm, but in this case,
identified through proximity searches across databases. Brief news
reports from St. Petersburg, warnings about possible cholera outbreaks,
and repudiation by medical experts of these warnings were examples of
textual exchange that linked mass circulation newspapers, medical
periodicals, and individual doctors and researchers as "information
brokers," again using Cordell's suggestive terminology. An analysis of
the complex relationship between cholera and influenza requires, as
suggested by Cordell's research, an appreciation of the potential of the
digitized archive to suggest connections in ways that can transform
interdisciplinary research.

This study also confirms the arguments of Christopher Hamlin's *Cholera.
The Biography* about the distinctive ways cholera connected expert,
political, and popular discourses about health, culture, and
community.[^14] Hamlin's research is especially productive in its
examination of how broad claims about cholera were often based on
limited, doubtful, and even non-existent evidence. Newspaper editorials
and even doctors made frightening predictions of future cholera
outbreaks based on repeated reporting about a single, mostly
misunderstood, statement from a Russian physician, just as Hamlin's
examples show that most published reports about cholera perpetuated a
simplified version of the disease that served rhetorical purposes yet
were often far removed from medical analysis.

Focusing on the discussion of whether influenza was causally related to
cholera is a way to understand how researchers understood etiology in
1889, how knowledge circulated between expert and public audiences, and
how information was disseminated globally, regionally, and locally. A
doctor's public statements, a wire service report published in
newspapers, and editorials in medical journals are representations to be
examined as a way to understand these broader processes. Whereas recent
scholarship in digital humanities has suggested new and potentially
transformative arguments for the value of network analysis for
understanding authorship and readership, this study argues that
historians need to go further to ask how practices of republication also
contained elements of validation, correction, and even repudiation.
Research on the circulation of medical knowledge requires more than the
identification of clusters in order to understand how the public,
newspapers, and medical experts made sense of a new threat to public
health and sought to communicate this understanding to expert and public
audiences. This study also contributes to new perspectives in digital
history by examining a situation where a Russian scholar participated in
the scientific debate---not as an exotic representative of the Other,
but as a highly qualified expert---whose expertise made it worthwhile
to offer a reasoned critique.

In spring 1892, just two years later, a devastating cholera epidemic
struck Russia, causing more than 250,000 deaths, and prompting health
officials to acknowledge that unsanitary living conditions, particularly
lack of clean water, contributed to high case and death rates.[^15] In
other words, the 1892 cholera outbreak validated demands for preventive
measures raised by Zdekauer during the 1889 influenza outbreak. In fact,
following Zdekauer's death in early 1897, the *British Medical Journal*,
which had adamantly denounced any connection between influenza and
cholera, offered a belated concession: "It will be remembered that when
influenza appeared in Russia in the autumn of 1889, Zdekauer was
strongly of the opinion that an epidemic of cholera might be expected to
follow, a view which was justified by subsequent events."[^16]

For historians, understanding the significance of Zdekauer's statement
requires both the large scale searching and sorting available from
digitized collections and the close reading and contextual
interpretation necessary for critical analysis. While the sensationalist
nature of the popular press as well as the scientific concerns of the
medical press combined to bring global attention to a remark made at one
meeting in St. Petersburg, these same sources also enable the historian
to interpret the purpose and meaning of these remarks in their context.
Tracing the reporting on Zdekauer's statement reveals how quickly
misinformation could be transmitted on a global scale at a time of
heightened concern about the threat of widespread disease. Yet these
same sources, including newspapers and medical journals, also
demonstrate how quickly both the leading authorities in medical science
and publications aimed at public audiences questioned these reports and
presented authoritative alternatives based on reasoned analysis.
Affirming the dissimilarity of influenza and cholera also served to
affirm the value of a public sphere which allowed for measured
discussion, thoughtful intervention, and the articulation of an emerging
scientific consensus about disease etiology.

### Notes

Funding for this project was provided by a bilateral digital
    humanities grant, Tracking the Russian Flu, from the National
    Endowment for the Humanities, and from the Department of History at
    Virginia Tech. In its initial stages, the project benefited from
    collaborations with undergraduate research assistants Veronica
    Kimmerly and Sinclair Ewing-Nelson. Earlier versions of this draft
    received productive comments from Jeffrey Reznick, PhD, and
    participants at the 2015 American Association for the History of
    Medicine Annual Meeting.

[^1]: The same comments from Dr. Albert Robin also appeared in the
     [*Omaha Daily Bee*](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn99021999/1889-12-15/ed-1/seq-1/), December 15, 1889, 1; [*Evening Star*](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1889-12-17/ed-1/seq-9/) (Washington DC), December 17, 1889, 1; ten days later, in the [*Iowa County Democrat*](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86086852/1889-12-27/ed-1/seq-1/), December 27, 1889, 1; and another week later, in the [*Wood County Reporter*](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85033078/1890-01-02/ed-1/seq-5/), January 2, 1890, 5.

[^2]: This article was located with a proximity search tool that found
    approximately fifty pages in the Library of Congress Chronicling
    America database with the terms "influenza" and "cholera" within 50
    words of each other during December 1889, the month when the Russian
    influenza first attracted global newspaper coverage. More results
    can be found by accessing commercial databases, including Proquest
    Historical Newspapers, America's Historical Newspapers, and
    newspapers.com, although the overlap between these collections
    complicates efforts to quantify and compare results. This search
    function is much more efficient than reading through thousands of
    newspaper pages to find articles that may have addressed the
    connection between these two diseases. In fact, nearly all of the
    results from this search technique were articles, editorials, or
    other reports about the possible relationship between these two
    diseases, with just a few examples that did not make this
    connection. The fifty pages with both terms in proximity marked just
    6% of the nearly 900 pages with the term influenza during this same
    time period in the same digitized collection. Yet knowing how to set
    up the proximity search using the right keywords and data parameters
    depends on an understanding of the distinctive historical context as
    well as the identification of the right questions.

    completing his Doctor of Medicine degree in 1842. In the 1860s, he
    led Russian efforts to investigate the cholera outbreak, which led
    to recommendations to implement sanitary measures. In 1878, he
    became the first present of the first Russian National Health

    As will be seen in this chapter, the name Здекауеръ was printed in
    many different spelling variations, which further complicates the
    use of text search tools to trace the spread of these reports.

    13, 1889: "Dr. Shrady recalls epidemics of influenza in 1847 and
    1866, but each time followed by cholera, but he says: "That was a
    coincidence, I think. I do not think there was any connection
    between the two, and I apprehend no trouble to New York from cholera
    now. The city is too well fortified against cholera." [*Evening World*](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030193/1889-12-13/ed-1/seq-1/), December 13, 1889, 1. For more on Dr. Shrady's significance during the Russian
    influenza, see Ewing, Ewing-Nelson, and Kimmerly, "Dr. Shrady Says."
    Similar dismissals were voiced by medical experts both nationally
    and regionally in the days that followed. On December 14, 1889, the
    *Salt Lake Herald* published an interview with Dr. Louis Sayer,
    another New York physician with a national reputation, who similarly
    drew upon his memories of recent outbreaks to clearly differentiate
    between the two diseases: "My advice is that when it comes don't get
    scared. Trust to Providence and keep you powder dry, as it were, by
    keeping up courage while you relieve your misery and preserve your
    strength as much as possible. Go slow, take it easy, take good care
    of yourself, and you will have done all you can to lessen the
    misery. From influenza, or its subsequent results, the suggestion
    that it is liable to be followed by cholera is nonsense. I anchored
    cholera in the bay when it visited this country last, and it can be
    kept out without any trouble." [*Salt Lake Herald*](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85058130/1889-12-14/ed-1/seq-1/), December 14,
    1889, 1.

[^10]: In a *Pittsburg Dispatch* article published December 17, 1889,
    Dr. William Pepper from the University of Pennsylvania reviewed the
    symptoms of influenza, and ended with this summary statement: "There
    is, therefore, no ground whatever for alarm about a possible
    outbreak of cholera. The two diseases have nothing whatever in
    common, and the intestinal type of influenza does not present any
    greater danger than the resperator type." [*Pittsburg Dispatch*](<https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024546/1889-12-17/ed-1/seq-1/>),
    December 17, 1889, 1.

[^11]: One interesting feature of this discussion, however, was the
    tendency to suggest that the public continued to believe in a
    connection between these diseases, despite the repeated affirmations
    of medical experts. *The New York Times* on December 10, 1889
    warned: "It is the popular belief in Europe that the present
    epidemic of influenza is the forerunner of an epidemic of Asiatic
    cholera...While there is no direct connection between the influenza
    epidemic and a visitation of the cholera, there is at the present
    time great danger of the appearance of cholera in Europe, because it
    is already prevailing in the region just east of the eastern
    extremity of the Mediterranean." [*The New York Times*](<https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1889/12/10/issue.html>), December 10,
    1889, 4.
    Yet newspapers themselves contributed to the persistence of these
    claims. On December 28, 1889, the *Pittsburg Dispatch* published an
    editorial that repeated the claims attributed to Dr. Zdekauer almost
    a full month after his comments had been widely repudiated by
    newspapers, journals, and doctors: "One of the most unpleasant
    suggestions in regard to the influenza epidemic is that it is in
    some way connected with cholera, and is frequently a forerunner of
    it. A skillful Russian specialist on both diseases, Prof. Zehekaner
    [sic], favors this view. But his argument and those of his
    followers only prove that certain atmospheric conditions favor both
    diseases. We of this latitude have a liking for a cold winter, and
    if it is needed to keep cholera away from us next summer our prayer
    is for frost and lots of it." [*Pittsburg Dispatch*](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024546/1889-12-28/ed-1/seq-4/), December 28,
    1889, 4.
    Some newspaper reports attempted tried to explain why this erroneous
    belief persisted---even among members of the medical profession, as
    in this analytical article in the *Pittsburg Dispatch* on January 5, 1890. After stating that influenza "runs across the country from
    southeast to northwest, as cholera does," the article stated that
    influenza often moved against the prevailing air currents yet could
    travel quite far in a short period of time, leading to this broad
    analytical statement: "This remarkable faculty it has of traveling
    so rapidly as against the general course of the air makes it
    resemble cholera, and from the fact that it has on two occasions
    been followed during the next summer by cholera, some wise
    physicians have had an idea that it might be followed by the same
    disease next summer. It follows no more than smallpox follows
    whooping cough." [*Pittsburg Dispatch*](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024546/1890-01-05/ed-1/seq-16/
