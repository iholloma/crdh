  This project melds archival salary data and demographic data to examine the lives of men and women working in a Wall Street investment bank in the early twentieth century. Linking online database records for the 1900 and 1910 U.S. Censuses, it traces workers’ moves over time and the emergence of a gendered landscape in the New York metropolitan area that prefigured trends in other cities. While male employees grew increasingly likely to live in or move to the suburbs, women employees tended to move to or remain in urban neighborhoods. Examining household data reveals that while women did not receive acknowledgement as family “breadwinners” in fact both male and female workers on Wall Street supported other relatives with the ample salaries they received. In addition, the data indicate female white-collar workers were likely to move considerable distances for employment, often accompanied by other family members rather than being solitary “women adrift.” Government records from other online databases reveal the forms of material and social support women workers provided each other as roommates, traveling companions, and recommenders. The findings illustrate the potential of using digital databases to examine middle-class lives and particularly working women’s lives.

"Mapping Mobility" uses a database of the homes of the Wall Street
workforce to shed light on the experiences of middle-class women and men
who worked alongside each other but increasingly identified as city
dwellers and suburbanites, respectively. Using the 1900 and 1910 U.S.
Censuses, the project links residential records to trace the emergence
of a gendered metropolitan landscape that would become an important
cultural element in many American cities over the following decades.
Tracing the mobility of male and female workers reveals a bifurcation
between men whose movement to the suburbs was typically prompted by
marriage and women who spent long periods of their lives in the
workforce---almost always to support other relatives as family
breadwinners. At the heart of this study is a database merging
demographic data on more than 100 employees at Brown Brothers & Co., one
of Wall Street's most important investment banks in the Gilded Age, with
salary data from the firm's records held at the New-York Historical
Society. The study uses linked records from the 1900 and 1910 Censuses
to trace the dispersal of the Wall Street workforce throughout the New
York metropolitan area. Wall Street workers were leaders of the charge
towards the emergence of a male, suburban, white-collar workforce: in
1910, when only 16% of all clerical workers lived on the fringes of the
United States' metropolitan areas, 23% of New York's banking workers
lived there.[^1]

Previous researchers into the lives of white-collar workers have
usually had to decide whether to focus on the workplace or the home.
White-collar workers tend to be broadly scattered, making data
collection more difficult in an era before easily accessible digitized
sources. Spatial analyses of the white-collar workforce have typically
used microfilmed Census records, a cumbersome source base, to locate
clusters of workers in specific neighborhoods and provide "thick
description" of their everyday experiences.[^2] This approach, however,
limits our understanding of workers' mobility over time and the role of
family structure in shaping class and geographic mobility for the
white-collar middle class. Demographic analysis is particularly
important to understand the trajectories white-collar workers saw among
their peers and to determine how this shaped their aspirations. As
powerful coalitions were emerging to "sort out" neighborhoods and
establish impermeable boundaries between different categories of
workers, white-collar men and women would have been particularly
conscious of how their housing choices---or compromises---were likely to
have repercussions for themselves and their families.[^3]

In the late Gilded Age---the years between the depression of the 1890s
(the United States' largest before the Great Depression) and the
outbreak of World War I---a major reorganization of the American economy
occurred that centered on New York City's capital markets. At its core
were several thousand professional men who led Wall Street's investment
banks, brokerages, law offices and accounting firms and oversaw the
movement of hundreds of millions of dollars in and out of the financial
district each year.[^4] These professional firms, in turn, depended on
the labor of tens of thousands of clerical workers who acted as the
behind-the-scenes "stagehands" of the economy.[^5] To recover the
experience of ordinary salaried workers who left behind few records that
are easy to retrieve, this project uses the Brown Bros. data as the
basis for a website that takes in multiple scales of analysis, from
digitized neighborhood maps and college reunion yearbooks to family
histories uploaded to the Internet. The results of this metropolitan
methodology can be explored by visiting "[Mapping Mobility](http://gscho.net/scalar/mapping-clerks/index)," a companion
website to this article, which uses a 1901 map of the New York
metropolitan area as a device for displaying the migrations of the Brown
Bros. workforce and incorporates brief biographies of each of the staff
members found in the Census data.[^6]

{% endfigure %}

Understanding women workers' role in this process has been particularly
difficult due to a dearth of personal documents. The Brown Brothers
records provided a new way to examine this question. The firm had been
an important marketer of Southern cotton in the antebellum years but
hesitated to participate in the railroad and industrial booms of the
Gilded Age, allowing "others...[to] reap a rich harvest in which the
firm would have shared," as one partner later lamented.[^7] Although
Brown Brothers declined relative to firms like J.P. Morgan & Co., it had
its own office building at 59 Wall Street, a "marble palazzo" built to
its specifications in 1865 and expanded in the 1880s to seven
floors.[^8] Like many other Gilded Age firms, it had to adapt to
business opportunities made possible by a more robust communication
network and burgeoning flows of information, growing between the late
1890s and 1910 from 40-something to over 100 employees.[^9]

The firm sought out new groups of workers to fill these needs, such as
white men from non-"Anglo-Saxon" backgrounds---a trait that
distinguished New York firms from employers elsewhere.[^10] Employees
hired in the 1870s included men from elite New York families like the
Hones and LeRoys; by the 1910s, however, the roster included surnames
like Appleberg, Butzow, and Montanye. Similarly, in 1897 the firm hired
its first three female stenographers, and within months partner James
Brown was declaring "I can scarcely understand how we did our business
without women."[^11] Compiling names and salary information from the
ledgers and combining this data with records retrieved from digitized,
text-searchable 1900 and 1910 federal censuses on Ancestry.com was one
way to understand how women took advantage of these new opportunities.
Of the 123 people who worked at Brown Bros. in either 1900 or 1910, at
least one record was found for 115 individuals (93%), and for 72
individuals (59%) records were found in both 1900 and 1910. A total of
187 records were found, or 76% of the potential total (246, = 123 x 2). These retrieval rates are
roughly comparable with other published studies of migration that use
demographic records.[^12] Three-quarters of the 20 women working at
Brown Bros. in either 1900 or 1910 were found in both Censuses.

Data on the 49 employees who were in the American workforce in both 1900
and 1910 sheds light on the development of a metropolitan landscape
shaped by gender.[^13] None of the seven women in the workforce in both
years lived in suburban New York; meanwhile, 43% of men were living in
the suburbs by 1910.[^14] Instead, all the women lived in urban areas of
the metropolis---four in Brooklyn and three in Manhattan. While
descriptions of white-collar women regularly questioned if they were
shirking their destiny to become wives and mothers, closer examination
of the seven women's households suggests their decision to work was
attributable to fulfilling familial obligations. The average salary of
female Brown Bros. workers was $1,000, far higher than what
stenographers in other cities earned and also than the $800 mark considered
a desirable working-class "family wage."[^15] At a time when one in five
working women in New York was a boarder or a lodger, all seven women
lived with family members.[^16] In fact, among the eighteen women
workers found in the database, only one, Florence M. Bryan, was recorded
as living in New York independently. Put simply, rather than being
"adrift," as the contemporary stereotype would have it, white-collar
women were more likely to be *attached* to their families.

The handful of experiences in the Brown Bros. data suggest that women in
the white-collar workforce took on responsibility for their relatives
that might well entail moving a considerable distance. This attachment
produced two different patterns in the data. One pattern was of class
stasis: the four working women who lived in urban New York in both years
were in the same houses in 1910 as they had been in 1900, and all were
living with family members. In a period when moving indicated class
mobility, this suggests women's salaries were necessary for maintaining
their families' homes and status. The other pattern found is of women
moving with or joining family members in New York City. Frances Kingsland,
for example, a schoolteacher in western New York in 1900, moved to
Harlem with her widowed mother; Helen Heydinger, who in 1900 was a
stenographer living on her own in Boston, a decade later was working at
Brown Bros. and living with her mother in downtown Brooklyn.[^17]
Daughters likely felt stronger pressure to remain with their older
relatives while sons were encouraged to pursue careers independently;
they were seen as fulfilling their "natural" role as homemakers even as
they left the home to earn the income to sustain it.[^18]

Meredith Waterbury's experiences further illustrate this pattern.
Waterbury, who joined the firm in 1904 and became the head of its stenography department in 1909, was a unique example of an adult
woman who was not in the workforce in 1900 but later entered it. In
1900, she was living near West 131st Street in Harlem with her husband,
Sherman, a jewelry salesman. The 1905 New York State Census shows the
couple living on West 140th Street with a two-year-old son, Chester.
Then, in the 1910 Census, Meredith Waterbury is recorded living near
145th Street in Harlem with the now seven-year-old Chester. Further
searching reveals Sherman Waterbury was still living at the building
where the family was recorded in 1905. This indicates the couple had
separated and Meredith Waterbury was using her salary of over $1,100 to
support herself and her son.

The women whose salaries supported their families were not acknowledged
as "breadwinners" and the Brown Bros. salary data show that while they
were often hired with larger salaries than men they were less likely than men
to enjoy substantial salary increases over the following years. The
digitized government records available within Ancestry.com suggest that
working women turned to each other for support. Thus, the 1915 New York
state census reveals that Meredith Waterbury and Gertrude Hulst, who had
worked alongside her at Brown Bros. from 1906 to 1909, were lodgers of a
family living on West 70th Street.[^19] Similarly, a digitized U.S.
State Department passport shows that when Waterbury sought to become
an American Red Cross nurse in France in summer 1917, she turned to
Amelia A. Thompson, another stenographer at Brown Bros., to affirm her
identity.[^20] Thompson, in turn, was recorded in a 1928 passenger
manifest returning from a cruise to Bermuda alongside her colleague
Isobel Law.[^21] These linkages suggest that mutual material and social
support was one way women workers managed the inequitable pay structure
of the workplace and the pull of family obligations at home.[^22]

The development of a metropolitan white-collar workforce in which gender
shaped where men and women lived was largely ignored. Newspaper articles
on female clerks tended to emphasize the housing problems of unmarried
urban newcomers and suggested these would be resolved as they married
and left the workforce. The circulation of stories about women taking
clerical jobs to find a wealthy husband helped reinforce this
framing.[^23] Cumulatively, this had the effect of relieving
journalists, policymakers, and the public from considering the role of
gender ideology in shaping men's and women's mobility. It also made
women who spent long careers living in urban neighborhoods and working
in the white-collar workforce largely invisible.[^24]

Similar forms of structural discrimination have shaped the uses of the
historical evidence. Little work has been done to substantiate or refute
the assumption that office work was only a temporary occupation for
women.[^25] Presumptions about the difficulty of finding women who
changed their names on marriage shapes research in the present, even
when digital methods are used: a recent paper on using machine learning
to automate Census linking regretfully concludes that linking women is a
difficulty that cannot yet be surmounted.[^26] Yet this small study
suggests that linking women over time in digitized records is not an
insurmountable problem. Unless historians participate more vigorously in
the discussion of how digital methodologies will be applied to old
records, we are likely to continue to rely on suppositions about women's
lives---and all people's lives---based on imperfectly gathered evidence.

    employees back to the 1900 Census, I focused on those who were
    teenagers or older in 1900 and thus more likely to be in the
    workforce. Additional searching would probably find more future
