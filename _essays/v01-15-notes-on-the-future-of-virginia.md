  Between 1785, when the first English-language edition of <em>Notes on the State of Virginia</em> was published, and January 1826, less than six months before his death at Monticello, Thomas Jefferson and his Virginia-born friend and “adoptive son,” William Short, engaged in a remarkable conversation about the fate of blacks in Virginia’s post-emancipation future. From their respective posts in Europe and United States, they discussed issues of race, slavery, emancipation, agricultural reform, and alternative labor systems based on European models (<em>villeinage</em>, or serfdom, and <em>metayage</em>, or sharecropping). Both men observed the condition of Europe’s white laboring poor while serving there as diplomats in the 1780s; both recognized the dangers posed by slavery in the Haitian Revolution of the 1790s and Gabriel’s Rebellion of 1800; and both expressed a desire to experiment with new labor systems that could provide a way out of slavery while preserving the agricultural basis of Virginian and American society. Yet they differed pointedly on the racial destiny of African Americans and the best path to a post-emancipation society in Virginia. Short directly challenged Jefferson’s views on black inferiority and questioned his continuing support for the colonization/expatriation/expopulation of blacks as the only viable alternative to slavery.

Thomas Jefferson's views on race and slavery are well known to
historians of the early American republic.[^1] In several oft-analyzed
passages from *Notes on the State of Virginia* (1785--87), Jefferson
envisioned the transformation of Virginia from a rigidly hierarchical
slave society, dominated by a small but powerful planter elite, to a
post-emancipation *herrenvolk* democracy rooted in classical republican
values and embodied in the idealized figure of the white yeoman farmer.
Jefferson's plan, drafted for consideration by the Virginia General
Assembly, called for the gradual replacement of black slave labor with
white free labor. As the state reduced its slave population through
*post-nati* emancipation and the removal of freed blacks to a far-off
colony, "beyond the reach of mixture," ships would be sent to "other
parts of the world for an equal number of white inhabitants." Jefferson
anticipated practical, if not moral, objections to his plan: "It will
probably be asked, Why not retain and incorporate the blacks into the
state, and thus save the expence [sic] of supplying, by importation of white
settlers, the vacancies they will leave?" In summoning this straw man,
Jefferson sought not to open public debate but to constrain options for
Virginia's post-emancipation future with a master's treatise on history,
memory, race, and national identity. He wrote: "Deep rooted prejudices
entertained by the whites; ten thousand recollections, by the blacks, of
the injuries they have sustained; new provocations; the real
distinctions which nature has made... will divide us into parties, and
produce convulsions which will probably never end but in the
extermination of the one or the other race." Jefferson's objection to
race-mixing on "physical and moral" grounds further buttressed his
argument against the incorporation of emancipated slaves as subjects or
citizens.[^2]

Jefferson held fast to these views from the first printing of *Notes* in
1785, when he was 42, till his death in 1826 at age 83. Not even the
private pleadings and patient arguments of his close friend and
confidant, Virginia-born William Short, could persuade Jefferson to
budge from the positions staked out in *Notes.* [^3] A close reading of
relevant Jefferson-Short letters, spanning four decades (1787--1826) and
two continents (Europe and North America), reveals Jefferson's stubborn
adherence to, and reaffirmation of, his public positions on race,
slavery, emancipation, and colonization. Where others tried and failed,
Short tried and tried again. A letter-by-letter analysis of their
correspondence, as presented in the digital companion to this article,
reveals the frustration Short experienced in urging Jefferson to
reconsider his views and the strategic thinking behind Short's
ideological retreat from European-style abolition to a more
Jefferson-friendly plan of gradual reform and amelioration.

Jefferson's public speculations on black inferiority and his insistence
that slaves, when freed, must "be removed beyond the reach of mixture"
drew several pointed challenges from his contemporaries. In 1791, the
African-American surveyor and astronomer Benjamin Banneker sent
Jefferson a copy of an almanac he had compiled, along with a letter
protesting the continued oppression and enslavement of the "African
race." He advised Jefferson and his compatriots to "wean" themselves
from their "narrow prejudices" toward African Americans and to, "as Job
proposed to his friends, 'put your soul in their souls instead."
Jefferson wrote Banneker a polite, if somewhat opaque, reply: "No body
wishes more than I do to see such proofs as you exhibit, that nature has
given to our black brethren talents equal to those of other colors of
men, & that the appearance of a want of them is owing merely to the
degraded condition of their existence both in Africa & America."[^4]
Yet, privately, as historian Winthrop Jordan and others have observed,
Jefferson "could not rid himself of the suspicion that the Negro was
naturally inferior." Jefferson rejected evidence of Negro "genius" as
anecdotal or---worse---fabricated by friends of the race, and he held
fast to his insistence on the colonization of emancipated slaves and
free blacks as the only viable solution to the inextricably intertwined
problems of race and slavery in Virginia.[^5]

Perhaps the most sustained critique of Jefferson's views came from
within his own inner circle. Short---who was born to a prominent
slaveholding family in Surry County, Virginia, and was related to Jefferson by marriage---enjoyed many of the same social privileges and political
advantages as his mentor. Like Jefferson, Short attended the College of
William & Mary, where he studied moral philosophy and became a founding
member of the Society of Phi Beta Kappa. Like Jefferson, Short studied
law under George Wythe and joined the Virginia Bar. Like Jefferson,
Short served on Virginia's Executive Council---a prestigious appointment
that might have served as a stepping-stone to higher office. Yet, unlike
Jefferson, Short chose a path that took him out of state and---for more
than two decades---out of country. In 1784, he sold his slaves, which
he had inherited from his father, left the Commonwealth of
Virginia---never to settle there again---and moved to Paris to serve as
Jefferson's private secretary. There he embraced radical ideas on human
freedom and equality and questioned the idea of race at the foundation
of America's slave society.[^6]

While in Paris, Short's clerical duties included the preparation of
Jefferson's *Notes* for their first authorized publication. "Suffice it
to say," writes Short's biographer, George Green Shackelford, "that
William Short was proof-reader and copy-boy for this undertaking."[^7]
It is clear, from their correspondence during their joint European
residency (1784--88), that Short embraced Jefferson's idea of replacing
slave with free labor, but rejected Jefferson's insistence that blacks
be removed "beyond the reach of mixture" as a condition of their
freedom. In a letter to Jefferson dated October 2, 1788, Short reports
on his investigation into the European agricultural labor system of
*metairie* (sharecropping) and comments on the prospects for
transforming "our slaves" into *metayers* on the French model.[^8]
Likewise, in a letter dated October 28, 1788, Short reports that the
Milanois system of sharecropping is "less complicated in one respect
than in France, and of course better for the genius of the
negroes."[^9] Where Jefferson saw no viable future for blacks in
Virginia, Short envisioned a permanent place for them as sharecroppers
and tenant farmers in a post-emancipation economy.

When Jefferson returned to the United States in 1788, Short---to Jefferson’s dismay---remained behind, preferring the cosmopolitan world of Paris to the plantation slave society of Virginia.[^10] Throughout his long residency in Europe, Short corresponded regularly with Jefferson about diplomatic appointments, investment opportunities,
and, most notably, Virginia's future as a post-emancipation society. In
an extraordinarily pointed letter to Jefferson, dated February 27, 1798,
Short argued that "keeping 700,000 people & their descendants in
perpetual slavery" posed a far more intolerable threat to humanity than
"the mixture of the two colors." Race-mixing, he maintained, was
inevitable, as natural as the cross-breeding of flowers and as capable
of producing awe-inspiring beauty as "the perfect mixture of the rose
and the lily." Short offered a point-by-point rejoinder to Jefferson's
plan of *post-nati* emancipation and colonization, as set forth in
*Notes*. He noted the degrading and dehumanizing conditions of slavery
in America. He compared calls for the expatriation of free blacks from
America to the expulsion of the Moors from Spain, and he pondered the
devastating cost of expelling the nation's native-born "agriculturers."
Short cited the recently reported discovery of advanced civilizations in
the African interior as evidence of "the perfectibility of the black
race," and he predicted the rise of "populous & extensive nations of the
black color, formed into powerful societies who will par in every
respect with whites under the same circumstances." Short acknowledged
the depths of anti-black prejudice among white Americans, but saw
movement in law and society toward "the restoration of the rights of
citizenship of those blacks who inhabit the U.S."[^11]

Jefferson’s silence on the topic spoke volumes. Receiving no response to his lengthy missive from Jefferson for nearly
two years, Short wrote a follow-up letter dated December 18, 1800: "I
have never heard from you whether you recd. a very long letter I wrote
you some years ago of the date of Feb. 27. 98....It went a good deal
on a subject to which I think it of importance that our countrymen
should pay attention---that of slaves---I know none more deserving of
their most profound researches."[^12] Jefferson eventually answered
Short, but without ever acknowledging the substance of the 1798 letter.

In *The Hemingses of Monticello: An American Family*, historian Annette Gordon-Reed offers a brilliant close reading of Short’s 1798 letter—--and Jefferson’s apparent reluctance to respond—--within the context of Jefferson’s intimate sexual relationship with his slave, Sally Hemings. With the 1798 letter, Gordon-Reed speculates, Short sought to move
Jefferson toward recognition of African Americans---and not just the
mixed-race Hemings family of Monticello---as worthy of manumission and a
path to citizenship. Jefferson, she concludes, ignored the letter and
"changed the subject" to avoid an extended foray into matters both
highly personal and politically explosive.[^13]

Historiographically, Gordon-Reed provides the rationale for my *longue
duree* study of the Jefferson-Short correspondence by viewing Short's
February 1798 letter as part of an extended "conversation" that began
with Short's preparation of *Notes* for publication. "Short knew the
exact significance of his choice of words [on race and race-mixing],"
she writes, "for this was a direct challenge to some of the best-known
of Jefferson's passages in Query 14 of the *Notes*."[^14]

Like Gordon-Reed, I view *Notes* as a critical reference point in a
running dialogue between Short and Jefferson on race, slavery, and
Virginia's post-emancipation future. Where Gordon-Reed focuses on a
single noteworthy and seemingly isolated exchange, I expand the corpus
to include nearly 75 letters between Short and Jefferson spanning nearly
four decades, 1787--1826.[^15] Where Gordon-Reed advances her argument
in narrative form, within the context of a book-length study, I present
mine using an open-access interactive visualization platform---VisualEyes---that employs multiple "views" and invites readers to explore selected "themes" and "threads" running through the
correspondence.[^16] While this dialogical approach cannot capture the
fullness of Jefferson's thought, or the various positions he took in
correspondence with others, it can illuminate the rhetorical thrust and
parry, across *time* and *space*, between Jefferson and one of his
closest friends and confidants.

*Notes on the Future of Virginia: The Jefferson-Short Letters,
1787--1826*, culls Jefferson-Short letters from a range of published
sources to create an online essay/exhibit/interactive visualization that
doubles as a scholar's resource.[^17] It invites users to explore
selected "themes" and "threads" running through Jefferson and Short's
extended "conversation" and ruminate on the significance of time and
place and key events in framing their ideological positions and
worldviews. The site combines brief introductory essays, annotated
excerpts, and interactive visual displays to chart the shifting
ideological positions and rhetorical stances assumed by Jefferson and
Short. It privileges user-driven "exploration" in the Storyline View
(figure 1) and author-driven "interpretation" in the Discourse View
(figure 2).

{% figure caption: "Figure 1. The StoryLine View invites users to follow topical threads

{% endfigure %}

In the StoryLine view users can isolate topical threads---slave labor,
agriculture, sharecropping, serfdom, tenancy, manumission, colonization,
rebellion, and Short's property at Indian Camp---for easy tracking in
a timeline format. Color-coded bands at the top provide framing context.
When users click on individual letters, a text box displays relevant
data (author, date, location), key excerpt in italics, analysis/summary
of contents, links to a scanned image of letter and full text
transcription (if available), and relevant excerpts with ellipses.

{% figure caption: "Figure 2. The Discourse View favors author-driven “argument” over user-driven “exploration.” It features introductory essays and annotated excerpts from the selected letters---organized chronologically, thematically, and geospatially" %}

{% endfigure %}

The Discourse View (figure 2) highlights the geospatial dimensions of
the conversation. Selected place names referenced within the
Jefferson-Short letters appear as "hot spots" on the stylized world map;
textual annotations illuminate the local-global dimensions of the
discussion and provide geopolitical context. The relative addresses of
sender and receiver are displayed using icons (J for Jefferson, S for
Short) on a stylized world map, with editorial notes providing context.
These markers convey the physical distance between the two men and---at times, as noted in particular letters---the intellectual and
emotional distance between them as well. A beta-version Position Tracker
visualizes the convergence/divergence of Jefferson's and Short's
positions on key issues (expatriation/forced removal) across time and
space in sync with the threaded display of letters.

The local-global dimensions of the Jefferson-Short discourse can be seen
clearly in a subset of 40 letters dealing with a property known as
Indian Camp. In 1795, hoping to entice Short to return from his
diplomatic post in Europe and settle among a close circle of friends
(including James Monroe and James Madison) in Piedmont Virginia,
Jefferson arranged for Short's purchase of the 1,334-acre Indian Camp
tract near his Monticello home. Two competing visions of Virginia's
future---Jefferson's desire to replace plantation slavery with
small-scale, sustainable, white tenant farming and Short's abolitionist
dream of transforming slaves into free laborers---emerge from their
correspondence on Indian Camp. Writing from Paris in 1798, Short
endorsed Jefferson's plan to have Indian Camp "tenanted out," but
expressed doubt that white tenant farmers would be willing to do the
work of slaves in a slave society. Instead he proposed that "some person
of fortune & well known" (a thinly veiled allusion to Jefferson) conduct
an experiment in free black tenant farming on a selected portion of land
to demonstrate the profitability of "converting" slaves into tenant
farmers. "Let all the minute calculations of detail be entered into &
published in the gazettes---Whatever may be the result of the first
essays, time & repetition will I think infallibly shew the advantage of
free, above forced, labor."[^18]  Jefferson disregarded Short's
suggestion and instead recruited white tenant farmers to work the Indian
Camp land---possibly with the assistance of rented slaves---according
to his strict rules of crop rotation. The property served, I would argue,
as a canvas on which the two men sketched their competing visions of
Virginia's post-emancipation future.[^19]

The visualizations provide a stereoscopic view of two prominent white, native-born Virginians---bound by ties of family and social class---as they grappled with the most pressing social, political, and economic issues of their day. Both men observed firsthand the condition of Europe's white laboring poor (serfs and sharecroppers) and drew pointed comparisons to that of America's enslaved blacks; both recognized the mortal dangers posed by slavery in the Haitian Revolution of the 1790s and Gabriel's Rebellion of 1800; and both expressed a desire to experiment with new labor systems that could provide a way out of slavery while preserving the agricultural basis of Virginian and Southern society. 

Yet Jefferson and Short differed profoundly on the inevitability and
desirability of "race-mixing," the capacity of black people for
citizenship in America, and the prospects for a peaceful transition to
bi-racial democracy in post-emancipation Virginia. Short directly
challenged Jefferson's views on black inferiority and rejected
Jefferson's scheme of state-sponsored colonization as the only viable
alternative to slavery. An early advocate for black citizenship, Short
pushed Jefferson to consider the transformation of slaves into serfs
(*villeins*) or sharecroppers (*metayers*) as part of a larger societal
transition, following the European model, to a more advanced state of
freedom and civilization. That Jefferson ignored or rejected all such
appeals from Short, over the course of forty years, is significant. It
confirms his almost routine exposure to opposing views from within his
inner circle and accentuates the closed-mindedness that characterized
his thinking on the subjects of race and slavery.

Upon his return to America in 1810, Short settled in Philadelphia and
steadily retreated from his more radical views on race, emancipation,
and black citizenship. In a letter to Jefferson dated October 9, 1823,
Short wrote: "I must own that since my return & residence in America I
have considered all such efforts as mere visions. An insuperable
difficulty must ever be found in this, that every reform must depend
precisely on those whose prejudices & whose interests are the most
opposed to, & would be the most likely to take the alarm at any
squinting towards a reform." Where once Short endorsed the
transformation of slaves into citizens, Short now urged Jefferson to
consider---and publicly endorse---a plan for transforming Virginia's
slaves into serfs on the European model. Such a plan would prevent the
breakup and sale of families and, while preserving elements of
involuntary servitude, "modify and moderate the evil." Recalling
Jefferson's insistence, in *Notes*, on the removal of emancipated blacks
as a condition of their freedom, Short wrote: "I remember well that near
half a century ago you treated of this population, but then were in
favor of the expopulating system. If you should have now, like myself,
become convinced of the impracticability, or even of the inhumanity of
this plan, would it not be worth while to encourage the idea of changing
the condition of these slaves into that of serfs attached to the
glebe?"[^20] Jefferson was unmoved. In a reply to Short, written six
months before his death, Jefferson conceded Short's point that
converting slaves into serfs might improve their lot, but said he still
favored the "expatriation" of emancipated blacks to countries governed
and populated by people "of their own colour." Jefferson declared this
scheme "entirely practicable" and "greatly preferable to the mixture of
colour here."[^21]

Jefferson's death on July 4, 1826, freed Short to ponder the what-ifs of
their long-distance correspondence. What if Jefferson had been more
open-minded about the various schemes that Short put forward as
alternatives to slavery? What if Jefferson had accepted the leadership
role that Short and others had urged upon him? In an 1829 letter to
their mutual friend, John Hartwell Cocke, Short lamented the dearth of
any political movement toward antislavery reform in Virginia. "I have
long meditated on the best remedy for this evil of slavery in Virginia &
I have satisfied myself fully as to it---but wld never be able to
satisfy the owners & the Legislature of the State as to it. Mr. J., to
whom I had written on the subject a short time before his death, agreed
that mine would be the best remedy save one, wch. was his old one of
shipping them off. You know he did not easily renounce any idea which
he had taken up in this way."[^22]

    personally observed Jefferson living with two intelligent and
    attractive mixed-race African Americans working alongside with and
    being paid like free white workers---and the earth had continued to
    turn. Whatever he knew of [a sexual relationship between] Sally
    Hemings and Jefferson, Short had first-hand knowledge of Jefferson's
    general affection for her family. Why could not Jefferson's
    experiences be replicated all over the United States?" Gordon-Reed, *Hemingses of Monticello,* 536--539.

[^15]: Only transcribed letters from scholarly editions of Jefferson
    papers were included; no effort was made to conduct original
    research in archival manuscripts for this beta version of the
    project. The bulk of the letters were accessible through the Library
    of Congress's American Memory Project, the University of Virginia
    Press's Rotunda Series, and the Swem Library at the College of
    William & Mary. A small subset of the featured letters appeared in
    bound print volumes only, most notably Princeton University's *The
    Papers of Thomas Jefferson: Retirement Series*.

[^16]: Future iterations of the project, currently in development, will
    update the project to a more robust, mobile-friendly, HTML5 version
    of VisualEyes <http://viseyes.org/visualeyes> and revamp the
    interpretive display to include (a) relevant documents from outside
    the Jefferson-Short corpus and (b) themed exhibits that explore the
    agency of marginalized groups (free blacks, slaves, women, tenant
    farmers, sharecroppers, etc.) referenced in the correspondence.
