  This article examines the reactions of Virginia’s public welfare reformers to fears about the rise of prostitution and sex delinquency near state military training facilities during World War I. By visualizing data derived from the admissions logs of Virginia’s two segregated female reformatories, this article argues that the war provided the needed rationale to fund the expansion of state institutions and their programs to reform delinquent girls. Additionally, maps of the data show that the social engineering that targeted delinquent girls in Virginia spread beyond both its war camps and its cities into the mountains and other rural areas of the state. Scholars studying the history of female delinquency have argued that the vast majority of girls targeted for behavioral rehabilitation in the early twentieth century were typically poor, urban-dwelling daughters of working-class or immigrant parents. Virginia’s predominantly rural setting complicates our understanding of female delinquency as a problem stemming primarily from the challenges of vast urbanization. The case of Virginia suggests that delinquency studies to date may have been too urban in their focus, failing to see that rural communities were also targeting girls for incarceration and reform.

When the United States government called its young men to duty to
mobilize for the first World War, social welfare reformers feared that
young women would also follow. Reformers worried that concentrations of
young soldiers and sailors in the cities hosting the new war camps and
training facilities would draw scores of young, unsupervised girls who
would weaken the fighting force through the spread of vice and venereal
disease. This type of "girl problem" had existed since the
mid-nineteenth century, but the realities of mobilizing for the United
States' entry into World War I heightened concerns about wayward girls.
"Young girls are flocking to our camp towns, attracted by the khaki, as
well as by stories of the need for workers and fabulous salaries paid
them," one reformer wrote.[^1] Drinking and gambling posed
a threat, but reformers feared the worst offenses would stem from young
"charity girls" trading sexual favors for nights on the town, if not
outright prostitution.

Notionally, the "program of repression" designed by the Commission on
Training Camp Activities (CTCA) to manage such problems concentrated on
the immediate long-term quarantine and detention of women and girls
picked up near war camps, especially in the South where many such camps
were located.[^2] To accommodate the expected influx of
reprobates, President Wilson directed $250,000 into a program to help
establish or refurbish reformatories and detention homes in states with
war camps. During the war, seven Virginia cities hosted war camps and
training facilities. At the time, Virginia was one of only a few states
in the South with an existing reformatory for white girls; it was the
only southern state with an institution for African American girls.
Thus, in 1918, Virginia's two female reformatories received funds from
this Federal program to help them manage the burgeoning local "girl
problem." The Home and Industrial School for Girls at Bon Air
(hereinafter Bon Air) received $30,000, and the Industrial Home School
for Wayward Colored Girls at Peake's Turnout (hereinafter Peake's
Turnout) received $20,000.[^3]

The environment of war camps and concentrations of soldiers fueled
public attention and Federal funds to mitigate female delinquency, but
these wartime concerns actually tapped into a long history of reform
and social control. The desire to control female delinquents can be
traced back to the opening of the first reformatory for girls in 1856.
However, between 1910 and 1920, local governmental and reformers'
investment in the custody and treatment of female delinquents increased
dramatically.[^4] Scholars, such as Steven Schlossman,
Stephanie Wallach, and Mary Odem have argued that the vast majority of
those targeted for reform during this period were poor, urban-dwelling
daughters of working-class or immigrant parents. Thus, scholarly efforts
to understand the response to female delinquency have situated it in
large industrial cities with fluctuating immigrant
populations---Milwaukee, Chicago, New York, and Los
Angeles.[^5] Recently, the field has expanded to include
southern strategies for dealing with wayward girls, notably within the
strict racial hierarchy that structured society in the
South.[^6] Historian Susan Cahn has argued that as
economic instability and crop failures drove internal migration to the
South's industrializing cities, black and white working-class girls
became a prime target for social control and reform.[^7]
As such, the war period, with its rapid migration to war-camp cities,
provides an important lens through which to understand the Southern
response to female delinquency.

Historian Nancy Bristow has observed that the perception of a wartime
delinquency crisis presented reformers with an opportunity to use the
Federal government as an instrument of "social engineering" that
extended broadly beyond the war years and war camp geographies to other
cities across the nation.[^8] Indeed, in Virginia, the war
provided the needed rationale to increase funding to delinquency reform
programs already underway. As a result, these institutions grew in
capacity and size. Surprisingly however, the social engineering that
targeted delinquent girls in Virginia spread beyond both its war camps
and its cities. Admissions data from Virginia's two female
reformatories indicates that as these two institutions expanded, they
admitted more girls from the mountain and rural
jurisdictions.[^9] Thus, Virginia's "girl problem"
extended well beyond its city borders.

### Insistent and Persistent Demand?

Anna Petersen, Superintendent of the Home at Bon Air, reported in her
annual letter to the Board of Directors in 1919 that the growing demand
to receive larger numbers of girls has been "insistent and persistent."
She stated, "we have turned away several hundred girls in the past year
because we had neither buildings nor equipment to care for
them."[^10] Indeed, Petersen's noted space issue seems
to have affected their ability to house more delinquent girls during the
war crisis, as the admissions data shows that until 1919, the admittance
rate for both Bon Air and Peake's Turnout remained relatively
consistent. The unexpected timing of an admissions spike in 1919 (as
shown in figure 1) indicates that instead of using the grant funds to
immediately incarcerate more delinquent girls, the reformatories took
the year to expand their institutions and reaped the resulting benefits
after the war ended.

<figcaption>Figure 1. Total Admittance by Year. Admittance totals by year signal a significant shift beginning in 1919. After 1919, admittance rates tripled for Bon Air (blue) and doubled for Peake's Turnout (red). This shift created a new baseline admittance rate that held steady throughout the 1920s and 1930s.</figcaption>
</figure>

Although the perception of a wartime delinquency crisis increased
public attention and funds to reformatory institutions, Virginia's two
reformatories for girls had been admitting inmates since before the war.
Between 1915 and 1918, both institutions averaged an admittance rate of
20 girls per year. After the war, Bon Air averaged an admittance rate of
61 per year, three times as many as the years prior. Peake's Turnout
averaged 38 admissions per year, nearly double the rate it had been
prior to the war.[^11] It is important to note that these
reform schools admitted, paroled, transferred, or discharged inmates on
a rolling basis. Most inmates stayed in residence for at least 18 months
before parole; some were transferred earlier. This means that the actual
capacity at each school remained constant while the admittance numbers
would fluctuate pending available beds. The administrators could parole
girls to create the needed space, but only at the risk of sending an
"unreformed" girl back into the environment from which she came.

Evidence suggests that both schools used the wartime grants to improve
upon their physical plants and add more cottages. At Bon Air
administrators repaired their existing dormitories and offices, built a
new cottage, and for the first time, lit their facility with electric
lights.[^12] At Peake's Turnout, the staff contracted the
construction of two new cottages and made other much-needed
improvements.[^13] These construction projects increased
their capacity, which ultimately allowed them accept and support more
girls, a trend that continued until well into the 1930s. In 1917, both
Bon Air and Peake's Turnout reported a maximum capacity of 50 inmates.
In 1921, they reported a capacity of 95 inmates and 80 inmates,
respectively. By 1921, Bon Air also boasted 50 more acres than it did
before the war.[^14] Federal funds provided for the
growth and expansion of Virginia's two female reformatories, but did
the wartime delinquency crisis ensure more girls were picked up in war
camp cities across the state?

### War Camps and Wayward Girls

Virginia hosted war camps in three main areas of the state. In Northern
Virginia in the city of Alexandria, and the towns of Fort Belvoir, and
Quantico; in the city of Petersburg, just south of Richmond; and in the
Norfolk region, in the cities of Hampton Roads, Newport News, and
Portsmouth. At the time, Virginia's largest city by far was the capital
city of Richmond with just over 171,000 residents recorded in the 1920
U.S. Census.[^15] The war mobilization effort spawned
rapid industrial growth and expansion in Virginia's other cities across
the state, especially in areas with a war camp. The Army's Camp Lee,
near Petersburg, was constructed in only three months with
accommodations to house and train over 60,000 men.[^16]
The city itself experienced a population increase of nearly 30 percent
between 1910 and 1920.[^17] The ports and Naval bases
near Norfolk at Hampton Roads, Newport News, and Portsmouth moved
massive quantities of men and goods overseas. Members of the American
Expeditionary Force, totaling approximately 288,000 soldiers and
sailors, sailed from Embarkation Hampton Roads during
1917--18.[^18] The cities near Norfolk expanded with the
growth of the camps. Norfolk and Newport News experienced an average
population increase of 74 percent between 1910 and 1920; in Portsmouth,
the population grew by 64 percent during the same
period.[^19] As the host cities expanded, they became
targets for concern over a growing delinquency problem.

With the growth of the war camps, the superintendents of the two
reformatories for girls expected to see an influx of inmates as a
result. Janie Porter Barrett, Superintendent of the Home at Peake's
Turnout expressed the importance of protecting war camp cities from the
scourge of disease in her 1919 Annual Report. "Since the day the special
appropriation was given to our school by the Fosdick Commission and our
State to take care of the girls who would be harmful to the War Camp
community, we have felt that we had a very important part in winning the
war."[^20] Yet, the admissions data from both
reformatories indicates that neither institution incarcerated
proportionally more girls from the war camp cities. Instead, data from
the sentencing jurisdictions, which were scattered across the state,
shows a surprising volume of girls originated from the mountains and
other rural areas of Virginia.[^21]

<figcaption>Figure 2. Wartime Admittance. Wartime admittance logs indicate that despite efforts to address war-related delinquency, war camp cities sentenced less than one-third (12 of 42 total) of all girls incarcerated during 1918. Instead, 52 percent (22) of reprobates originated in Richmond. The remaining girls originated in the western mountains along the Blue Ridge. Total admittance is scaled by volume and is represented by green points; gray points represent the seven war camp cities. Click on all points for more information.</figcaption>
</figure>

During 1918, 42 girls were admitted to a reformatory. As indicated by
figure 2, less than one-third (12) of the inmates incarcerated during
the war came from the war camp cities. By comparison, the Richmond
courts alone sentenced over half---52 percent or 22 total---of all the
girls incarcerated during the war. As the largest city in the state,
this dominance is not unexpected. Additionally, Petersburg's Camp Lee
was located less than 30 miles from Richmond, so it's possible some of
these girls were caught with enlisted men. However, without detailed
court records, it is impossible tell whether the girls admitted from
Richmond during the war were "caught" keeping company with a soldier or
a sailor.[^22] The remaining girls incarcerated in 1918
came from locales along the Blue Ridge Mountains, far from the war
camps.[^23]

<figcaption>Figure 3. Post-War Admittance. After the war, commitments from Norfolk and Petersburg, both war camp cities, increased. Richmond's influence decreased from 52 percent (22 of 42 total) during the war to only 31 percent (57 of 182 total) after. Rural cities and towns in the western mountain areas and to the southwest of Petersburg committed more than one-third (61) of the delinquent girls admitted in 1919 and 1920. Total admittance is scaled by volume and is represented by green points; gray points represent the seven war camp cities. Click on all points for more information.</figcaption>
</figure>

In the two years following the war, 182 girls total were admitted to the
girls' reformatories in the state. As seen in Figure 3, Richmond's
overall influence fell as other locales around the state began
committing girls with greater frequency. After the war, Richmond
committed only 31 percent (57) of the total girls admitted, down from 52
percent during the war. War camp cities show a jump in admittance
compared to the patterns seen in 1918. After the war, the war camp
cities sentenced approximately 35 percent (64) of girls admitted. Of
these, more than 75 percent originated from either Norfolk (28) or
Petersburg (22). Of the two, Norfolk saw the most significant growth
during this period, jumping from a population of just over 67,000 in
1910 to well over 115,000 by 1920.[^24] Norfolk's
geographic proximity to the camps at Newport News, Hampton Roads, and
Portsmouth, may account for the jump in sentences, but without detailed
court records, it is difficult to tell for certain. Surprisingly,
following the war, the mountains and rural areas south of Petersburg
grew in dominance, sentencing more than one-third (61) of girls admitted
to a reformatory.

Based on the available evidence, Virginia courts never sentenced one
hundred percent of convicted delinquents to its reformatories. The State
Board of Charities and Corrections, the oversight organization
responsible for Virginia's reform institutions, usually reported to the
Governor that an average of 75 percent of all convicted delinquents were
either paroled or fined and released.[^25] They usually
accompanied this statistic with an appeal for more parole officers
across the state, so separating the politicking from the reality remains
difficult. Counties and cities were encouraged to adhere to "juvenile
court ideas," but in 1918, only Richmond and Norfolk had a sitting
juvenile court. Richmond's size and presence of a separate juvenile
court could explain its dominance during the war, but not its drop in
influence after the war ended. This theory should also hold true for
Norfolk, which also saw rapid growth and had the only other juvenile
court in the state in 1918. Yet, during the war, the data indicates that
Norfolk sent only 3 (of 42 total) delinquent girls to a
reformatory.[^26]

While the State Board of Charities and Corrections did require the
juvenile courts to report on the number of children tried, details about
these cases and their disposition are inconsistent from court to court
and from year to year. In 1918, Norfolk reported only that they saw 608
total juvenile cases involving boys and girls. It provided no breakdown
of the charges or disposition of them. By 1919, the Norfolk juvenile
court began reporting more details. Out of the 86 cases involving girls
in that year, 70 percent (60 cases) were dismissed, fined, suspended or
placed on probation. The rest were committed to various other
institutions in the state; only 10 cases (12 percent) were committed to
the girls' reformatories.[^27]

### Observations and Conclusions

These visualizations based on admissions data from The Home and
Industrial School for Girls at Bon Air and the Industrial Home School
for Wayward Colored Girls at Peake's Turnout indicates that although the
war supplied the financial support to help them expand, the grants did
not ensure the long-term detention of wayward girls picked up in war
camp cities. Instead, admittance rates remained relatively constant
during the war, increasing only after these reformatories had time to
use the funds to expand their institutions and increase their
capacity. Despite Federal and State reformers' concerns over the
alleged wanton reprobates flocking to camp cities, the evidence shows
local courts were incarcerating girls from all over the state. At the
time when Virginia's cities were expanding thanks to the war effort,
nearly one-third of the delinquents confined to one of the state's two
reformatories originated from a mountain or rural area.

Virginia's predominantly rural setting complicates our understanding of
female delinquency as a problem stemming from the challenges of vast
urbanization and immigration. By visualizing both the volume of
admissions and the geography of where girls were arrested and sentenced,
we get a clearer picture of how the rhetoric of a wartime delinquency
crisis may have translated to Virginia's local communities. The case of
Virginia seems to indicate that delinquency studies to date may have
been too urban in their focus, failing to see that rural communities
were also producing female reformatory inmates. Further research is
required then to understand how Virginia articulated and managed this
unique "girl problem," especially in terms of race and class.
