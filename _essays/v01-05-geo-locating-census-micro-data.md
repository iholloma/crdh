abstract: |
  The settlement of foreign-born migrant communities in London has received considerable scholarly attention. Using the recently released Integrated Census Microdata, this article contributes to the literature as it argues that individualised mapping processes can reveal distinct settlement patterns within migrant communities. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that migrants were highly mobile entities and that communities continuously underwent radical transformations. Two areas of East London are used as case studies to highlight the different behaviours exhibited by migrant groups during a period of intense arrival and settlement. These neighbourhoods were selected on account of the availability of geo-spatial and census data. After processing in a Geographic Information System, data is explored and mapped to illustrate the concentration and composition of individual properties. Ultimately, this article presents evidence of tight migrant clustering and the gradual spread of migrants as they eventually settle entire streets. The decennial changes highlight some form of interchange. As migrants left one subsection, they moved to another. Although the literature indicated and suggested strong tendencies of residential clustering, this research has demonstrated the complexities of this point and revealed a number of previously unexplored behaviours.

### I. Introduction

"We must look to the census as our basic source," stated Lloyd Gartner,
"and almost entirely abandon attempts to derive annual immigration
figures from other sources."[^1] Gartner's 1960 emphasis on the census
as the fundamental source for studying migration and migrants remains a
salient point. Despite the digitisation of new sources concerning
immigration into Britain, including Naturalisation Reports, the census
remains the most extensive socio-economic dataset for the subject.

Most studies of population mobility and Britain are in reference to
those who emigrated, rather than those who arrived. However, with an
extensive Empire, the United Kingdom served as the crossroads of the
world, with individuals and communities arriving throughout the long
nineteenth century. Between 1881 and 1911, hundreds of thousands of
foreign-born migrants entered, passed through, and settled into England
and Wales. Including the Irish, almost a million foreign-born migrants
were residing in England and Wales by 1911, with a much larger
second-generation progeny.

Scholars have long noted the spaces of exception where large,
distinctive migrant communities formed.[^2] However, studies have
typically relied on registration district geographies as the spatial
unit of investigation. The aggregation of populations at this level
results in distortions and betrays the complex behaviours occurring at a
neighbourhood and street level.[^3] Current research is attempting to
redress this reliance upon amassed population statistics. Through two
case studies of Victorian and Edwardian London, this article argues that
the individualised geo-locating of households as enumerated in the
census is of far higher value when measuring segregation amongst migrant
communities. Further, this article demonstrates that with time, migrants
were intrinsically mobile and areas of settlement underwent profound
transformations.

### II.

To explore the segregating behaviours of migrants at an individual
household level, two examples are drawn from neighbourhoods in the East
End of London. The area is well-known for its popularity with migrants.
During the nineteenth century, thousands of Europeans arrived as they
escaped military service, oppression, economic depression, and
increasingly dangerous conditions. Many came from the Russian Empire.
The scale of the migration was extensive. As one correspondent noted:

> We are face to face with a new Ghetto, one that has arisen during this
> generation, vastly greater in area than the old and different in
> character. It has absorbed the Mint, Whitechapel, and Stepney; it
> stretches out to Shoreditch, to Hackney, and to Stratford, and even
> across the river. In many streets in these districts four out of six
> names over the shops are Polish, German, or Russian, and the remainder
> are often Anglicized forms of foreign names. There are roads where
> scarce an English person is to be found, where the common speech is
> Yiddish, and where the majority of the adults speak only a little
> broken English. New immigrants settle here, 10, 20, or 30 thousand a
> year.[^4]

Popular anxieties emerged in light of this migration and growing
settlement, including overcrowding, displacement, and competition.[^5]

The neighbourhoods selected are subsections from the Whitechapel
Registration district, as highlighted in the map of East London. The
subsections are well suited for further analysis. Both experienced
changes over time and diverged in their composition. When comparing the
areas with George Arkell's map of Jewish East London, the subsections
sit on the boundaries of the Jewish community. The first subsect centres
on Underwood Street in the north of the district, which contained 252
residential properties. Located between a series of major roads, subsect
one remained well connected. Only Buttress Street led to a dead end.
While North Place was an enclosed space, it had an additional small side
passage back to Buxton Street. The second subsect is located around
Dorset Street, on the district's western fringes, and was comprised of
272 residential properties. The area included the Tenter Ground Estate
and contained a number of lodging houses, shops, and industrial
buildings.[^6] The area was densely populated and its residents suffered
from poverty and overcrowding. The estate was essentially a cul-de-sac,
and houses were small and cramped. The subsect contained a number of
small courts, closes, and enclosed areas, which resulted in the streets
becoming an important space for socialising and interacting.[^7]
Although the subsections differed, they are representative of the local
area.

### III. Subsect One

The population of the Underwood Street area underwent profound change
during the latter decades of the mid-late Victorian period. In 1881,
there was a near total absence of foreign-born persons, with only a
scattering of isolated migrants. By 1891, migrant clustering had begun
to emerge. Portions of Buxton Street, Underwood Street, and Bakers Row
(later Vallance Road), exhibited strong segregating behaviours amongst
its migrant population. Yet, large numbers of properties remained solely
inhabited by the native-born population. From 1901 onwards, the
foreign-born population formed a distinctive residentially segregated
area.

Some minor segregating behaviour existed between migrant groups. In
1901, the only two residences with Romanians living in them were
situated next to each other on the corner of Buttress Street and Buxton
Street. The dominance of Russian migrants and the ambiguity of national
identity complicate any further analysis into inter-group segregation.

With the gradual expansion of the foreign-born community in nearby
districts, the Buxton Street area became increasingly attractive for
migrants. After spreading from its core in Whitechapel parish,
increasing numbers of foreign-born migrants lived in adjacent districts
and streets. Pressures on the existing housing stock, slum clearances,
and the ability to afford more appropriate accommodation drove the
migrant population to new areas. However, migrants moved seemingly in
tandem with kin and kith groups, and pre-existing social networks.

On the south side of Underwood Street stood five large buildings
composed of multiple dwellings, known as the Metropolitan Association
Buildings. Throughout the period, the dwellings remained heavily
dominated by native-born persons, as did many of the houses in the
immediate vicinity. Persistent dominance by native-born persons might
suggest a link to redlining, or the unwillingness amongst some landlords
to rent to migrants, something to be explored further.

Decennial changes suggest migration into subsect one accelerated in the
early 1900s, with North Place becoming a heavily segregated space. In a
similar fashion, many houses on Buxton Street changed from being
occupied by native-born to foreign-born persons. Crucially, the period
1881--1891 marked the introduction of migrants to the area, which was
further amplified *en masse* in the following decade. The area rapidly
absorbed migrants, and clear evidence of congregating can be observed in
the map of 1911. Within thirty years, the neighbourhood underwent
profound changes, with the population radically changing in composition.

### IV. Subsect Two

The northern aspects of subsect two served as an isolated non-Jewish
community. One of those streets, Dorset Street, has been described by
Fiona Rule as the 'worst street in London' and was a notably transient
space, with many lodging houses and poor slum housing.[^8] Running north
from Dorset Street was Little Paternoster Row and two small-enclosed
courts. Crimes, including murder, frequently occurred.[^9] The
socio-economic composition of the population differed, as did the
birthplaces of migrants, with a Dutch community present in subsect 2,
and a predominantly Russian migrant community in subsect 1.

Segregation within the extent of subsect two was strongly evident in 1881. 
As illustrated in the maps of subset 2, at the time of the census
in 1881, Little Paternoster Row was almost entirely composed of persons
hailing from Poland. Meanwhile, Emery's Place had a sizeable
concentration of persons born in Holland. As time progressed, an
increased number of native-born households emerged, which suggests
either a return of native-born persons or second generation migrants
establishing new households.

By 1911, a sizeable proportion of the remaining foreign-born population
is residing in a cluster on one-side of Freeman Street. Overall, many
properties became devoid of foreign-born persons in any of the
households, undoubtedly as older migrants died or moved away, and were
replaced by second-generation migrants or other native-born persons. A
large number of properties retained a mixed composition in the absolute
numbers of migrants, but they become increasingly outmatched by
exclusively native-born residences.

Evidence exists to suggest a link between subsection one and two. In
1897, a group of over twenty Eastern European migrants were arrested at
the home of a Bernard Green at 4 Underwood Street for illegal gambling.
As was noted, 'All were described by the police as foreign Jews, natives
of Russian and Austrian Poland.' The apprehended all gave addresses in
Spitalfields, which included streets in subsect two.[^10]

{% figure caption: "Figure 6. The population is incredibly mixed with a scattering of households dominated by persons born in Holland. Some native-born dominated households can be found across the subsect, but there is a tendency for them to congregate in the northern elements. A number of properties had no-one living in them, a sizeable number being in the southern elements." %}

{% figure caption: "Figure 7. The number of native-born households continues to expand in the north aspects. Some households dominated by Russian-born persons are beginning to emerge in and around White's Row. Meanwhile, the number of empty properties decreases." %}

### V.

Communities underwent profound changes; at times within a brief space of
time. As Richard Cohen has noted, many Jewish migrants moved from
'slow-moving' contained communities to immense urban centres.[^11] The
disorientation generated by their new environment likely enhanced the
motivations to cluster together.

Within the two case studies, native communities reacted differently to
the new arrivals. In the case of subsect one, migrants quickly displaced
the native-born population in places, but it was limited to clustering
behaviours, which expanded over the decades. In rows of houses such as
Buttress Gardens, or in the eastern element of Underwood Street,
properties remained overwhelmingly populated by native persons.
Meanwhile, in other areas there was a near total absence of any
native-born persons, being almost solely composed of migrants and their
British-born kin. In contrast, subsect two revealed a complicated system
whereby migrants and natives lived in proximity to each other. Extreme
occurrences of segregation took place in isolated sub-streets, alleys,
and closes.

A key finding is that subsect one rapidly gained a large migrant
population and exhibited strongly segregationist behaviours. Meanwhile,
subsect two began to lose its first generation migrant population.
Similarly, the alleys and enclosed spaces of subsect two began to be
populated and dominated by native-born persons, possibly as the migrant
population moved on to other nearby areas. In their study of Vienna,
Harriet Freidenreich has demonstrated that diverse migrant groups
pursued different models of assimilation, with Galician Jews being far
more segregated than other communities because of their distinct
characteristics.[^12] A more extensive comparative analysis between
migrant communities and geographical areas will reveal how typical the
behaviours are.

To a certain extent, segregation was self-imposed. For many new arrivals
it was necessary to be in proximity to unskilled work
opportunities.[^13] There was also a religious and cultural dimension,
with the need to be near to a synagogue and other institutions. It is
now clear that the community was far from static with significant
intercensal movements occurring. In the case of the Jewish Eastern
Europeans, as David Newman has noted, new migrants often supplemented
the existing communities.[^14] The constant stream of new arrivals
contributed to the fluctuations on the border of the predominantly
Eastern European migrant community. However, work remains to be done to
establish whether these behaviours were comparable to that of other
major cities, including New York, Paris, or Chicago.

Ultimately, the individualised approach to residential segregation
offers a far greater degree of insight into the activities and
composition of migrant communities. As demonstrated in these two case
studies, aggregated analyses can mask localised experiences. While
certainly more work, the level of detail in individual household
geo-location is profound, and reveals distinct behaviours that we would
otherwise fail to recognise.
