  Better known by his <em>nom de plume</em> “Herblock,” Herbert Block was one of the most prominent voices of liberalism in the postwar era. In his role as political cartoonist for the <em>Washington Post</em>, he articulated the values of liberalism to a much broader national audience than was reached by the writings of other liberal writers and played a critical role in shaping public opinion across a wide-range of political and social issues. Yet traditional discussions of Block’s cartoons, in common with analysis of the work of other political cartoonists, rely on a close reading of a sample of hand-selected cartoons that are extrapolated to draw broad conclusions about the nature of his work. In contrast, this paper uses digital methods to analyze Block’s body of work from 1946 to 1976—a corpus of 8,500 political cartoons—in its entirety. Through a series of visualizations, it illuminates longer-scale trends in Block’s output that are otherwise obfuscated by the day-to-day nature of his working schedule and explores how Block’s political ideology was reflected through his cartoons.

In the space of a single week in March 1951, the *Washington Post*'s
political cartoonist Herbert Block, better known by his *nom de plume*
"Herblock," received plaudits from two of the nation's most prominent
liberals. "I have long admired your work," declared the noted Harvard
historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., in a letter dated March 1, "both
from an artistic point of view and as a cogent expression of political
and social liberalism."[^1] Five days later, Chester Bowles, the former
governor of Connecticut, sent Block a letter congratulating him on the
consistent quality of his work. "I honestly do not know anyone in the
publication field or radio field," he wrote, "who is presenting a
liberal viewpoint more effectively and consistently than you."[^2]
Despite these high-profile testaments to his liberal credentials, Block
was adamant that his cartoons reflected no specific political agenda and
that he was politically neutral. In a 1959 interview with the journalist
Henry Brandon, Block was asked if he found it "easier to draw cartoons
with the Democrats in office or out of office." He answered by declaring
that he didn't "think it makes much difference" as his cartoons were
"independent" of which party was in power at any given time.[^3]

Block's cartoons were not created simply for his own self-edification.
Because of their ability to appropriate multiple cultural and emotional
symbols in their efforts to visualize collective attitudes around
events, nations, and individuals, Block's cartoons engaged with what
Benedict Anderson has described as an "imagined political community"---a
public that shared a common set of assumptions and desires that was
connected to each other, not through personal interactions, but through
their readership of these cartoons.[^4] Block created his cartoons for a
readership that was largely made up of the white, northern,
white-collar, and male readership he believed to be the primary
consumers of the news and editorial pages of the *Washington Post*. It
was on this readership that Block's cartoons worked to create,
disseminate, and strengthen a set of assumptions and ideals about the
world in which they inhabited. By understanding the implicit and
explicit biases of Block's cartoons, and the extent to which he held
himself to his own standards of impartiality, we can more clearly
understand how those cartoons informed the opinions of his readers.

Although Block's cartoons formed just one element of the *Washington
Post*'s editorial page, appearing alongside both editorials and readers'
letters, they were given special prominence. Johanna Drucker's has
argued that "we *see* before we read...[which] predisposes us to
reading according to specific graphic codes before we engage with the
language of the text." This insight clarifies how the spatial
arrangement of text, headlines, and images on a newspaper's editorial
page provide the reader with visual clues as to how that page should be
read.[^5] With this in mind, figure 1 shows a generic representation of
the layout of the *Washington Post*'s editorial page. The focus is
intended to be on the two left-hand columns of editorials that extend
vertically across the length of the page. The placement of Block's
cartoon in the center-top of this page, however, inevitably draws the
reader's eye to this graphic element, granting it precedence over the
textual elements of the page. Consequently, Block's work had the
opportunity to influence the reader's understanding of the day's events
before other editorial content in the newspaper was read and
contemplated. Was this prominence accompanied by an unbiased handling of
differing political opinions?

{% figure caption: "Figure 1. Typical layout of the *Washington Post*'s editorial page,

Herblock cartoon at the top center of the page naturally draws the eye
of the reader, making it likely to be the first element of the page to
be read and therefore giving it an opportunity to influence how a reader
will interpret that day's editorial content." %}

{% endfigure %}

Block may have insisted that his work was unbiased, but his
contemporaries---as evidenced by both the praise of such luminaries as
Schlesinger and Bowles and the reactions of his readers---and later
commentators have been almost unanimous in their assessment that his
cartoons reflected a strong liberal ideology. At the level of individual
cartoons, however, it is certainly easy enough to find examples that
would seem to demonstrate that, while he may favor the individual
policies of one party over the other, Block nonetheless was even-handed
in his depiction of each party. For example, Block's April 11, 1951
cartoon "Reveille" condemns Truman's handling of General Douglas
MacArthur's public criticism of his administration's policies during the
Korean War, while June 10, 1957's "Whence All But He Had Fled" is
equally critical of Eisenhower's trade policies with China (figure
2).[^6] By considering all 8,480 cartoons drawn by Block between 1946
and 1976, we can understand not only the extent to which this
"independence" was maintained across multiple years and election cycles,
but more importantly how his liberal ideology shaped the perhaps
unconscious decisions that informed how he chose to depict specific
issues, events, and administrations.

{% figure caption: "Figure 2. (a) Herbert Block, 'Reveille,' *Washington Post,* April 11, 1951. (b) Herbert Block, 'Whence All But He Had Fled,' *Washington Post,* June 10, 1957." %}

{% endfigure %}

A straightforward place to start is the frequency with which members of
different political parties appeared in Block's cartoons. This metric is
useful because it allows us to understand the changing focus of Block's
work. Between 1946 and 1976, 2,176 cartoons featured a character that
represented either a member of the Republican Party, versus 1,192
cartoons with at least one Democrat.[^7] Breaking these totals down by
year reveals patterns that provide further insight. In fact, the only
periods in which Democrats appeared more frequently than Republicans
were during those years in which a Democrat was President (figure 3).
This is not a surprise. The party in power provided an opportunity for
Block to draw not just presidents, but also vice presidents, secretaries
of state, and other cabinet members. It is therefore natural that we
would see a change in emphasis that matches the changes in
administration. Even so, there is a clear bias towards depicting
Republicans. The lowest percentage of depicted Republicans during a
Republican administration is the 26% drawn in 1969. This is comparable
to the *highest* percentage of Democrats drawn during a single year of a
Democratic administration---28.7% in 1952, an election year in which the
incumbent president did not seek reelection as the Democratic Party's
nominee.

{% endfigure %}

{% figure caption: "Figure 4. Herbert Block, 'The Short Cool Spring,' *Washington Post,* March 27, 1968." %}
![Herblock cartoon showing a man labeled “administration spokesmen” pouring a pitcher of water and ice cubes on a stack of papers labeled “Report on the Commission on Civil Disorders."](/assets/img/v01/appleford/figure4.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

One possible explanation for these differences is that Block shied away
from depicting real members of a Democratic Administration in a negative
light, instead choosing to voice any displeasure he might feel about a
policy without mentioning a specific official. Yet if that were the
case, we would expect Block to draw generic characters representing the
administration more frequently under Democratic presidents than he did
under Republicans. Block's depiction of the "Administration," a
character typically imagined as a nameless, often balding, bureaucrat
who represented the actions or interests of the White House without
showing a specific member of the administration, follows an exactly
opposite trend to this expectation.[^8] The black dashed line in figure
3 represents the frequency with which this character appeared in Block's
cartoons and suggests there is some relationship between the party in
power and the frequency with which the generic Administration character
was drawn. By calculating correlation coefficients of the frequency with
which each of these three factors appeared across the corpus of
cartoons, we can understand the extent to which the occurrence of the
"Administration" character is connected to an administration's
party.[^9] The correlation coefficient between Republicans and the
"Administration" character is 0.52, suggesting that a positive
relationship exists between the two variables. In contrast, the
coefficient for Democrats and "Administration" is -0.68. These results
indicate that the "Administration" character was more likely to be drawn
during a Republican Presidency and less likely when a Democrat occupied
the White House. While these values are relatively strong, they are
affected by such factors as the total number of cartoons drawn each year
and especially by the impact of presidential elections.

{% figure caption: "Figure 5. Percentage of Herblock cartoons depicting Democrats, Republicans, and the generic character 'Administration' averaged by presidential administration, 1946--1976. *Source:* Simon Appleford, *Herblock Cartoon Database, 1946--1976.* Data available at <https://github.com/apl4d/crdh>." %}
![Line graph showing how the percentage of Herblock cartoons depicting Democrats,Republicans, and the generic character “Administration”changed during different presidential administrations from nineteen forty-six to nineteen seventy-six."](/assets/img/v01/appleford/figure5.png)
{% endfigure %}

To compensate, we can calculate the average number of times that each
variable appears across each four-year administration. Several key
insights into Block's portrayal of members of each major political party
are revealed in figure 5. During the Truman Administration, the average
count for the depiction of Democrats and Republicans is almost identical
and it is after Eisenhower's election that Block's depiction of the two
parties permanently diverges. It also becomes clearer how the
president's party affiliation affects the average count. Although the
overall portrayal of Democrats is fairly consistent at between 10% and
20% of Block's total output for each administrative period, there are
clear drops in this figure each time a Republican won office.
Recalculating the correlation coefficient between Republicans and the
"Administration" character shows an increase in this value to 0.63; when
recalculated for depictions of Democrats and "Administration", the
negative correlation increases to −0.82. Compensating for the arbitrary
division of time into twelve-month periods better reveals the nature of
Block's portrayal of partisan actors in his cartoons and suggests how
the generic "Administration" character, which could have been used by
Block as a proxy representation of a presidential administration to
criticize a President's policies, was in fact more commonly used during
Republican Administrations to reinforce his criticism of that party's
policies.

These results also suggest further avenues of research. A key question
is to ask how the form of Block's cartoons reflected his biases. In
other words, while depicting, for example, the role of white southerners
in civil rights, did Block also change---consciously or
unconsciously---what he drew? One potential way of assessing this is to
consider the use of contrast in his cartoons. Most of Block's cartoons,
as seen in the previous examples of his work, generally made use of a
white (i.e. unprinted) background, which allowed his scenes and figures
to stand out against the page. When Block made greater use of dark
shading it was generally to suggest menace or danger. After calculating
the median brightness of Block's civil rights-related cartoons that
include a depiction of a white southerner, we do find that, although the
majority of these cartoons were predominantly white, Block was
marginally more likely to make greater use of dark shading when
depicting southerners than he was in the corpus as a whole (figure 6).

{% figure caption: "Figure 6. Scatter graph of median brightness of civil rights cartoons depicting southerners, 1946--1970. Red dots indicate civil rights-related cartoons that depict southerners, grey dots are all other cartoons in the corpus. The figure only depicts cartoons up until 1970 because after that year Block only drew three more cartoons that fall into this category---one in 1975 and two in 1976. The graph maps the average grayscale value for the pixels in each cartoon and are on a scale of 0--255. For example, if a cartoon is pure black, its median brightness will be 0; if a cartoon is pure white, its median brightness will be 255. *Source:* Simon Appleford, *Herblock Cartoon Database, 1946--1976.* Data available at <https://github.com/apl4d/crdh>." %}

{% endfigure %}

To better understand the context of these differences fully, figures 7
and 8 present slopegraphs that illustrate the major themes presented in
the periods 1957--1960 and 1965--1968.[^10] Comparison of these figures
reveal significant differences in how Block considered Democratic and
Republican administrations. Most immediately obvious is the relative
position and path of the "Eisenhower Administration" and "Johnson
Administration" subjects. Whereas the former made up 42.57% of all
cartoons in 1957 and only drops below a quarter of all cartoons in the
election year of 1960, the proportion of cartoons depicting the Johnson
Administration never rises above the 26.54% level seen in 1966. More
notable are the differences between the paths of the "Other" line---that
is, cartoons whose primary subjects were not drawn frequently enough to
achieve 3% of the total output in any of the years depicted in the
visualization. Between 1957 and 1960, this category never appears above
the "Eisenhower Administration" category. In 1965, however, the "Other"
category, is ranked behind the "Johnson Administration" subject by only
0.02% (or a single cartoon), and by 1967 is by far that year's most
common category, before dropping back down to the second most common
category in 1968, when Block's cartoons were heavily focused on the
presidential election. The significance here is that the higher the
value of the "Other" category, so too the greater diversity there is in
the types of events and subjects that Block chose to depict and comment
upon each year. Consequently, the trajectory of "Other" during Lyndon
Johnson's administration suggests that Block actively chose to draw
cartoons focused on a wider variety of topics than he did during the
second administration of Republican Dwight Eisenhower, this despite the
fact that Block found himself increasingly disillusioned with Johnson's
administration.[^11]

{% endfigure %}

These results certainly seem to suggest that, at some level, Block chose
his subject matter differently depending on which party held control of
the White House. Despite his constant assurances to Henry Brandon and
others, Block did not treat Republicans and Democrats in a substantially
similar fashion. During the presidencies of Dwight Eisenhower and
Richard Nixon, Block was especially focused on producing cartoons that
responded to the specific policies and actions of those Republican
administrations. In contrast, cartoons produced during the presidencies
of Democrats were more varied in their focus and commented upon a
broader range of topics and issues, indicating a reluctance on Block's
part to criticize the actions of these administrations and negating his
claims of "independence."

[^7]: To calculate these totals, a cartoon is only counted once for each
    party regardless of the number of Democrats or Republicans it
    depicts. People were designated as Democrat or Republican based on
    their publicly stated political affiliation at the time Block drew
    them. Changes in party affiliation are thus reflected in these
    totals. For example, the one 1948 depiction of Strom Thurmond is
    counted as representing the Dixiecrats, after which he is counted as
    a Democrat (four cartoons) until he formally changed his party
    affiliation in 1964 from which point his twelve appearances count
    towards the Republican total. These totals also include characters
    that were clearly intended to represent a specific political
    ideology by being either labeled "Republican"/"Democrat", drawn as
    the Republican Elephant or Democrat Donkey, or clearly depicted in a
    situation that indicates their party affiliation, for example with
    cartoons that depict the Republican or Democratic National
    Conventions.

[^10]: Each chart only plots a specific subject if it is the major topic
    for at least 3% of Block's output in one of the years visualized;
    other subjects are grouped together in the category "Other." For
    example, in Figure 8, the subject "Middle East" appears in none of
    the cartoons Block drew in either 1965 or 1968, but does appear in
    5.38% of his output for 1967 and consequently is found on the chart.
    The inclusion of the "Other" category is important as it indicates
    the variety of major subjects that Block's cartoons dealt with each
    year, without adding additional clutter to the visualizations.
